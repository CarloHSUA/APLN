      "Lista única: ['The announcement from Catherine, Princess of Wales that she has started chemotherapy for cancer and is in the “early stages of that treatment” was a bolt from the blue.As Britain woke up on Saturday morning, the tone of every major newspaper was of concern. The Times struck a reassuring note with its front page headline, “Princess reveals her cancer and says: I’m going to be OK.” The FT Weekend opted for “Kate puts end to speculation” while The Sun tabloid told the princess, “KATE, YOU ARE NOT ALONE”The 42-year-old princess revealed her cancer battle a day earlier in an emotional video statement, after weeks of relentless scrutiny over her health.It was a bold move. This is someone who gets nervous speaking in front of cameras, let alone about such a deeply personal matter. But the video – simply shot, on a bench in front of a spray of spring foliage – showed Kate earnestly sharing her  story on her own terms and in her own words.It was powerful to hear her speak so plainly and openly about what she is experiencing. That decision to connect with the public by herself would have been a decision she made in consultation with her husband, Prince William, who is heir to the British throne.The princess acknowledged that it has been a challenging few weeks. Interest in Kate – who vanished from view at Christmas – persisted this week after reports emerged that staff at the hospital where she was being treated in January may have tried to illegally access her private medical notes. It remains unclear if the alleged data breach was successful but three people are said to be under investigation.That somber development had followed an unprecedented hurricane of unfounded conspiracy theories which blew up in the absence of specifics surrounding her surgery in January, supercharged by William’s unusual absence from his godfather’s memorial in late February and the admission by Kate that she had edited a photograph released by the family to mark Mother’s Day in the UK earlier this month.The disclosure about her health puts a new perspective on that photo\\xa0– and the events of the past few weeks. The official line is that she had been recovering from abdominal surgery, when the reality was a lot more serious than that. Yet again, the royal family could face some difficult questions about what they chose to reveal to the public, and when.Beyond that, It is an extraordinary moment for the British monarchy. The institution is now facing one of its biggest crises in recent memory, with two of its most senior family members essentially out of action. It also leaves Prince William and Queen Camilla to front the institution while caring for their spouses.The cancer diagnosis of the future Queen comes on the heels of King Charles III’s own health battle, which was revealed in early February – less than a year after his coronation. The 75-year-old monarch also made the decision to temporarily step away from public duties as he undergoes cancer treatment (though he continues his constitutional obligations behind the scenes).With Britain still coming to terms with the King’s diagnosis, it is perhaps even more shocking to learn of Kate’s condition given her relative youth. To her devoted supporters, she is the epitome of good health, beauty and perfection. Since marrying into the family in 2011, she has rarely put a foot wrong and proven herself to be a dependable figure of “the firm.” That dependability has now been replaced by vulnerability, unsettling a steadfast institution.Many remember how she stood outside the Lindo Wing at London’s St. Mary’s Hospital – the de facto maternity ward for royal births – hours after giving birth to each of her three children. She is beloved for her poise and timeless elegance, making her one of the most popular faces of the family.Her health struggle is an abrupt reminder that while she is a public servant and a brand, she is also human and vulnerable.Many of the bizarre and outlandish conspiracies that have been recently thrown around with little regard dehumanized her. She became a commodity of the media, much like the previous holder of her title - Diana, the late Princess of Wales.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak succinctly summed up what many are now thinking moment’s after Kate’s revelation.“In recent weeks she has been subjected to intense scrutiny and unfairly treated by certain sections of the media around the world and on social media,” he said in a statement on Friday night.He said the Princess of Wales has the “love and support of the whole country” and urged for her to be “afforded the privacy to focus on her treatment and be with her loving family.”Kate had been expected to return to official duties after Easter, however she will postpone\\xa0her return until she has been cleared to do so by her medical team, a royal source told CNN on Friday. The source added she may make ad hoc appearances if she can find the strength. On those occasions, the decision to attend will be made at the last-minute and take people by surprise.Apart from that, we don’t expect any Kensington Palace updates unless her condition suddenly improves or worsens. The palace is also not expected to reveal any further medical details such as the type of cancer or what stage it is.From the institution’s view, the deal is: You, the public, have the video so you have the fullest health update the institution can offer. In return, allow the family some time to recover and rebuild.The line of succession is now under extreme pressure from the very top. Prince William – who Kate praised as “a great source of comfort and reassurance” – will continue to juggle caring for his wife and children while maintaining his public schedule.He will lean on the support from Queen Camilla and the seven other lesser-known working royals but as next-in-line to the throne, his presence out and about is needed to reassure the nation that the Crown is strong.What was clear in Kate’s video message was that the couple’s priority is their family. They both understood that her news would generate huge public interest, but her words made it clear that they are trying to preserve some semblance of normality for their children, George, Charlotte and Louis.CNN understands the Prince and Princess of Wales wanted to wait for their young children to be out of school for the Easter holidays before making the announcement.Kate is said to be in good spirits and firmly focused on her recovery but in the heartfelt statement, she called on the public to “understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy.”That space will be the challenge ahead for international media – the majority of which will want to be sensitive and respectful to the princess. Here in the UK, the press will be conscious of Kate’s request but whether that will be the case for international paparazzi remains to be seen.While the latest developments will not quash all the online hysteria surrounding the princess, having a clearer timeline of what Kate’s been going through since January has already gone some way in taking the edge off some of the more outlandish speculation.Many of those who fell down the royal rabbit hole in recent days quickly replaced their social videos with apologies and best wishes.There has been an outpouring of support and sympathy for Kate since she shared what she is going through, and perhaps her words will help reset how the world responds when wild conspiracy theories run rampant on social media.', 'Prime Minister Leo Varadkar sent shockwaves through Ireland when he candidly announced he was “no longer the best person” to lead his\\xa0country.The taoiseach took journalists, opposition lawmakers and even members of his own government by surprise with his decision to step down for what he called “personal” but “mainly political” reasons.The 45-year-old had become a familiar face on the international stage, having made headlines in 2017 when aged 38 he became the youngest prime minister in Irish history. Ireland’s first gay, mixed race leader soon became the face of a new and more liberal Ireland, shepherding in progressive social change through a string of successful referendums.He had taken up the role of taoiseach again in December 2022 as part of a job rotation agreed by the coalition government formed after the 2020 general election.In recent weeks, Varadkar had drawn praise for his solidarity with the people of Gaza, challenging President Joe Biden over sustained US support for Israel during a stateside visit last week.Irish Times political correspondent Jennifer Bray was given less than an hour’s notice of the surprise statement from the taoiseach on Wednesday. Bray told CNN that the resignation came as a “bolt from the blue for everyone.”Gary Murphy, Professor of Politics at Dublin City University, said there was a “certain humility” to the speech, not typically associated with a\\xa0politician often perceived to be “aloof” and “lacking the common touch.”Murphy said “a taoiseach resigning without any pressure from his party to do so is really unprecedented in the Irish state.”Even Varadkar seemed to be still catching his breath on Thursday afternoon when he told reporters gathered in Brussels for an EU leaders summit that the decision still hadn’t “sunk in.” He tried to dispel rumors that a scandal may be lurking on the horizon, stressing there was “no event” or “one thing” that\\xa0prompted his resignation.Despite this, questions\\xa0linger\\xa0over the timing of his decision, less than three months out from local and European elections. His successor, largely tipped to be Higher Education Minister Simon Harris, will need to\\xa0lead the center-right political party, Fine Gael, against a fired-up opposition.Leo Varadkar has often been described by commentators as a “man in a hurry,” having scored the country’s top job after less than 10\\xa0years in politics. Following a short-lived career as a doctor, Varadkar rose rapidly to the top, cutting his teeth in\\xa0high-profile jobs as health minister and transport minister.After he was appointed taoiseach in 2017, he quickly touted himself as a leader for the people “who get up early in the morning,” promising to bring financial prosperity and stability to Ireland in the wake of a devastating financial crash.And although opposition figures and some commentators branded him a “Thatcherite” proponent of neo-liberalism, Murphy insists Varadkar “never governed like that.”“His administration, even before [the Covid-19 pandemic] wasn’t shy about spending public money, it was just that they got no political capital or credit,” Murphy said.Varadkar’s steady leadership during the pandemic was\\xa0not something to be scoffed at, Murphy added. The Irish government took a more cautious approach to lockdown measures which, though at times unpopular, did culminate in significantly lower case numbers and death rates than its closest neighbor, the United Kingdom.He also scored a significant victory with his handling of the Brexit saga, Bray said, pointing towards his success in “breaking the deadlock around a no-deal Brexit” in 2019. His skill in handling former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson “did not resonate with the Irish public though, who wanted to hear less about Brexit and more about the solutions to what was a deepening housing and homelessness crisis,” according to Bray.Varadkar’s management of the housing crisis in particular will likely be the greatest mark on his legacy. Under both terms as taoiseach, the failure of his government to hit targets for affordable housing has left a generation of young voters unable to purchase homes.Under his tenure, Ireland did manage to shed some of the conservative societal norms propagated by the Catholic Church, through referendums legalizing same-sex marriage and lifting an abortion ban. This strong track record came to an end in early March, when a referendum to remove a constitutional reference to a woman’s place being in the home was resoundingly rejected, in a bruising defeat to Varadkar and his government.The “sheer scale” of the loss has “to have had an impact on his decision to go,” Murphy commented, saying Varadkar may have felt “some responsibility” for that.As several political heavyweights, including finance minister and Eurogroup chairman Paschal Donohoe, declined to throw their hat in the ring, the stage is set now for Simon Harris to become the next taoiseach.The 37-year-old who rose to prominence during his spell as health minister during the pandemic is considered by many to be a “mirror image” to Varadkar, Murphy said. A more affable and effective communicator however, Harris has built up a large online following through his frequent use of platforms such as Instagram and Tik Tok.“Simon Harris has promised to bring energy and vigor to the role, and Fine Gael will be hoping that he can connect them to an increasingly distant electorate: younger voters,” Bray said.He will face a galvanized opposition in the form of Irish nationalist party Sinn Féin, who have been making steady gains since their impressive election success in 2020. The party, led by Mary Lou McDonald, has leveraged the government’s failure to tackle the housing issue in particular, promising the electorate that it has the policies to end the crisis.The main question is whether Harris has “the political substance behind the polish,” Murphy added, saying his “big challenge” will be to present some ideas that “will catch the voters” ahead of the next general election, which must take place before March 2025.', 'When Duane Riley turns on his taps, they shudder loudly from the air flowing through the pipes. There’s often no water trickling at all.It’s ironic, because Johannesburg, South Africa’s biggest city, has plenty of water at the moment — authorities and water companies just can’t seem to get it to where it’s needed.“There have been times where we’ve had no water, but I’ve had a river gushing down my driveway, because there was a leak at the top of our street,” Riley told CNN. It took authorities 14 days to fix it, he said.Joburgers —\\xa0as residents here call themselves — are no strangers to water scarcity. South Africa is naturally dry, and the climate crisis has hit the nation many times with crippling drought.Johannesburg is one of many of the world’s big cities that are dealing with a perfect storm of crumbling critical infrastructure, lack of maintenance, corruption and insufficient planning for population growth.While drought can hurt the city’s reservoirs,\\xa0the dams are currently full, authorities say. But climate change is making things worse in another way — officials\\xa0say a weeks-long heat wave is boosting water demand in enormous volumes. In February, Southern Africa saw temperatures of\\xa04 to 5 degrees Celsius (around 7 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) above average.At around 9 p.m., Riley’s home typically loses water until around six in the morning.“But there have been multiple times where we’ve been without water for five, seven days,” he said.It’s impacting many parts of the city, from the wealthy northern suburbs to parts of the largest township, Soweto. In both places, people have been forced to collect water in buckets from wherever they can.Two months out from an election, authorities are blaming the latest shortages on a lightning strike on a pumping station, and also\\xa0pointing to the heat wave.But locals are no longer buying the excuses.“The heat wave we’ve been battling for two weeks. But we’ve been dealing with this long, long before that,” says Riley, who lives in Kensington, a hilly suburb east of the city. He says the battle has been going on for about a year.“They are just grabbing at straws trying to save face, and whatever excuse they can find to not really reflect the biggest issue,” added\\xa0Riley. That issue, he said, is maintenance.Riley recently organized two protests against the lack of basic services, including water and electricity supply, in his area, which hundreds of people attended.Ravin Singh founded the Water Crisis Committee civic group last September, after his neighborhood northeast of downtown Johannesburg was suddenly hit with prolonged outages.He’s had periods of more than a week without water. “The current situation is that we have water for parts of the day,” he said.For some who do get water, it often comes at a trickle, with low to no pressure at all, Singh \\xa0says.“Young families are able to cope, although it impacts on their work [and]\\xa0life. They have to change the patterns of when they bathe, when they cook, those kinds of things,” he said. “But people in old-age homes, for example, it’s very difficult.”Singh \\xa0says in the seven or eight months since the problems began in his area, he’s only seen a water tanker to provide emergency supplies around three times. And it’s difficult for the elderly to walk and carry water home.On Wednesday, Senzo Mchunu, the government minister for Water and Sanitation,\\xa0urged the City of Johannesburg to work on its turnaround time in responding to pipe bursts and leaks “as this is what is contributing to the high physical water losses.” In a statement, Mchunu said “it was clear” the city “requires serious interventions and funding to deal with its water infrastructure renewal program.”Johannesburg Water said in a statement Wednesday that its systems were “steadily improving and stabilising” after the trouble over the past two or so weeks. The company called on residents and businesses to help cut water use by 10%, requesting people fix leaks on their properties, take shorter showers and collect rainwater for outdoor use.This is a message it has been urged to pass on by the area’s supplier, Rand Water.\\xa0In a statement on March 18, Rand Water said the metro areas of Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg must reduce their water consumption to avert interrupted supply.Johannesburg’s reservoirs have long struggled with fluctuating levels, affected by natural events and high consumption. In September last year, authorities warned the city’s reservoirs and water towers were “critically low to empty” following a thunderstorm that caused a power failure at a treatment plant.Because many reservoirs are powered by electric pumps, high levels of scheduled power outages, or “load shedding” as it’s known in South Africa, have also cause low water levels at reservoirs. Now Joburgers also talk about “water shedding.”But Singh concedes that people could be doing more to lower water consumption, voluntarily.“I think it’s important, even if we didn’t have this crisis, we need to remind citizens that we live in a water-scarce country,” he said. “And we need to cut consumption.”If behaviors do not change, and maintenance and modernization of the water system are not taken seriously, Johannesburg could find itself in an even bleaker situation.It doesn’t need to look far to see what that future could be: Only two years ago, the South African city of\\xa0Cape Town was\\xa0counting down to “Day Zero,”\\xa0the day all taps would run dry.\\xa0\\xa0It averted that crisis. Now Joburgers are wondering if their city can do the same.', 'Were they real? Most people’s first reaction when viewing\\xa0French President Emmanuel\\xa0Macron’s moody black-and-white\\xa0boxing photos\\xa0this week was to question their authenticity. Had the bulging presidential bicep, veins popping, been swollen artificially?On social media, some wondered if they were AI-generated or the result of creative photoshopping. But the images were from the president’s personal photographer. Asked about the cynics questioning her work, she dismissed them.The social media meme factory cranked into action. Macron was\\xa0mocked up as Popeye, the spinach-eating sailor superhero. He was compared to “Raging Bull” Jake LaMotta. Less flattering photos of his arms were located and placed side-by-side. “Your profile picture vs real life,”\\xa0wrote one. Real boxing coaches critiqued his technique.But the images invite much larger questions. Why has he done this? And why now?The first part of the answer is that the 46-year-old has always been adept at making himself the center of the conversation. Since his first steps into politics in 2014, the self-styled\\xa0“disruptor”\\xa0knew how to harness the power of provocation. Politicians fear nothing more than irrelevance.He’s always been sporty too. His\\xa0soccer days\\xa0are long gone and he finds little time for his beloved tennis, but he has boxed in the gym at the presidential palace since winning power in 2017, sometimes taking aides or bodyguards as sparring partners.Getting the French moving is one of his current “national causes” ahead of the Paris Olympics this year. In January, he posted a video online, boxing gloves slung over his shoulder, urging French people to do\\xa030 minutes of exercise a day.But the photos said something larger. This was Macron pumped up, ready for a fight, with teeth gritted. Everywhere he looks at present, the centrist sees battles — most of them slipping away from him. The “Rocky” president might be in good shape physically, but he’s politically and diplomatically pinned in a corner.His second term in office, won two years ago with minimal campaigning, was immediately embroiled in\\xa0the country’s worst protests in decades\\xa0and has drifted since. Despite all-offense against the anti-immigration party of far-right leader Marine Le Pen in recent months, the polls keep getting worse.Le Pen’s party is on track to\\xa0win elections for the European parliament\\xa0in June again, with a possible\\xa010 point winning margin. No serious commentator excludes the idea of her succeeding Macron in 2027 anymore.\\xa0By some estimates, she and her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella,\\xa0are the second- and third-most popular politicians in the country.The French economy is also on the slide, risking a blow-out of public finances. Macron convened senior ministers and allies for dinner this week,\\xa0urging them over a seafood buffet\\xa0to find ways to cut spending.Bigger foes loom to the east and west.\\xa0Many observers concluded\\xa0the clichéd boxing photos were a message to the black-belt judoka in the Kremlin,\\xa0Russian President Vladimir Putin, a master of the staged display of male virility,\\xa0whether it be\\xa0bare-chested horse riding or spearfishing.Macron has plenty of previous form in this domain too, once posting a video of himself being lowered onto a\\xa0nuclear submarine by helicopter.Having spent months trying to avert war in Ukraine by sweet-talking Putin, Macron has transformed himself into Europe’s alpha defense hawk in recent months. Long gone are the days when he worried about\\xa0“humiliating”\\xa0the former KGB man and would chide Eastern European nations as\\xa0“war-mongers”.In late February, Macron\\xa0refused to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, sending a shockwave through European capitals. At the same time, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a political punching bag at home whose perceived weakness infuriates Macron, was refusing to deliver long-range missiles to Kyiv.Like leaders across the EU, Macron is also preparing for the possible return of Donald Trump to the\\xa0White House.\\xa0The French leader concluded that strength was the only language his bulky US counterpart understood during his first term in the White House.\\xa0Handshakes between the two men\\xa0were akin to wrestling matches, Macron once squeezing Trump’s knuckles so hard they turned white.By temperament, the former investment banker is a risk-taker. By instinct, he likes being on the front foot. He might appear to be on the ropes, with problems mounting in Paris, Kyiv and Washington, but he wants us to know that he’ll keep on swinging.', 'Russia on Sunday held a day of mourning after at least 137 people were killed in an attack on a concert venue in Moscow, the country’s worst attack in two decades.Nearly a dozen people have been detained in connection with the massacre on Friday night, which saw\\xa0armed assailants storm a popular concert venue complex\\xa0on the outskirts of the capital.ISIS\\xa0claimed responsibility for the assault in a short statement published by the ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency on Telegram on Friday. The attack was the deadliest to hit Russia since the Beslan school siege of 2004.Thousands of\\xa0people from cities across Russia lined up in the rain on Sunday to place flowers at a memorial outside the Crocus City Hall near Moscow to honor those killed. Hundreds of flowers and a group of white balloons were left at the scene.Members of the clergy also paid their respects and initiated prayers which crowds joined in with flags were lowered to half-staff.One of those there - 37-year-old Alexander Matveev - told CNN people in Russia felt insecure and worried another attack may take place.“I listened to Putin. He said they were trying to escape to Ukraine. This makes sense,” he said. “Let’s see what investigators say.”“But Russia is strong, we won’t give up,” Matveev added.Russian President Vladimir Putin turned out to pay his respects to the deceased, lighting a candle in a church at his Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow.The Russian leader first announced the day of mourning in an address to the nation on Saturday, to grieve the victims of what he described as a “bloody and barbaric act.”“The whole country, our whole people, mourns with you,” he said.Also during the address, Putin said attackers had sought to escape across the border towards Ukraine.He said that some on the Ukrainian side had helped prepare a “window” for their escape. Putin has also blamed the attack on “international terrorism.”The four gunmen suspected of carrying out the attack were arrested near the border on Saturday, Russian authorities said. Their nationalities have not been released.Ukraine has strenuously denied any involvement in the attack. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry describing the accusations as a “planned provocation by the Kremlin to further fuel anti-Ukrainian hysteria in Russian society, create conditions for increased mobilization of Russian citizens to participate in the criminal aggression against our country and discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the international community.”Amaq also released a graphic video on Saturday that purports to show Friday’s attack at a concert hall in suburban Moscow recorded by one of the attackers, suggesting the perpetrators had a direct link to\\xa0ISIS\\xa0in order to be able to send the video.The Russian Investigative Committee updated the death toll to 137 on Sunday, including three children.The committee added that 62 bodies have been identified so far.“For the remaining victims, genetic examinations are being carried out to establish their identities,” the statement said. “The investigation of the crime scene continues.”Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said molecular genetic examination may be required in some cases which will take at least two weeks.', 'Barely a week since Vladimir Putin secured his fifth presidential term, Russia has been plunged into carnage and disarray.The appalling attack on the vast Crocus City Hall concert venue and shopping complex near Moscow, which has been claimed by ISIS, has left hundreds of innocents killed or injured.The four men suspected of carrying out the attack were arrested near Russia’s border with Ukraine, Russian authorities said. Putin said they had planned to cross into Ukraine – Kyiv has denied any link with the attack and warned Russia could use it as an excuse to escalate its invasion.Amid fears of more attacks, security has been tightened at key transport hubs across Russia. Public concerts and sporting events have been postponed.This is hardly the stability and security for which so many Russians voted for President Putin.For years, the Kremlin strongman has been cast as a leader able to guarantee order in this vast, turbulent country.But Russia today seems more insecure and volatile than at any point in Putin’s 24 years in power.The Kremlin’s brutal war in Ukraine, now in its third horrific year, has cost Russians dearly. The military doesn’t publicize casualty figures, but US estimates suggest more than 300,000 Russians have been killed or injured.Many troops mobilized last year have still not been rotated from the frontlines, provoking an outcry from anxious relatives. As the war drags on, fears are growing among many Russians that the draft will be stepped up, sucking even more into the terrifying Ukrainian meat grinder.Meanwhile, Ukrainian drone strikes and cross border raids by Ukraine-based Russian militias opposed to the Kremlin continue apace.At the Ukrainian front, Russian forces appear to have the military initiative at present, but the poor performance of Russian commanders and weaponry over the course of the war has fueled an entirely unexpected stream of instability and internal dissent from bloggers and military hardliners enraged\\xa0at the incompetence of those in charge.The\\xa0mutinous uprising last year of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the\\xa0Wagner mercenary group\\xa0who was demanding the dismissal of the Russian high command,\\xa0was a shocking, unprecedented challenge to Kremlin authority.His fiery death in a mysterious plane crash shortly afterwards permanently removed any Prigozhin threat.\\xa0But other disgruntled hardliners may emerge.In the same way, the recent death of Alexey Navalny, Russian most prominent opposition leader, has permanently silenced a vocal Kremlin critic. But the thousands who attended his funeral in Moscow, or who turned out to vote in a Midday Against Putin mass gathering at polling stations on the last day of the presidential election, indicate a base of discontent.But now, the focus is firmly on the apparent reappearance in Russia of large-scale Jihadi terror attacks, unrelated to the Ukraine war or domestic opposition\\xa0to the Kremlin.To make matters worse, the US and other Western governments warned of intelligence suggesting such an attack in early March.\\xa0US officials say they have been notifying Russia on the intelligence for months.But for some reason, Putin chose to ignore this, describing the warnings as a “provocation… to intimidate and destabilize our society”.Perhaps it was distrust, with US Russian relations at such an historic low. It could also have been that the US intel was just too vague or not actionable.But for a leader who has promised security and stability to Russians, a major attack on Russian soil is yet another powerful blow.', 'Gunmen in an\\xa0entertainment venue. Bodies lying on the cold concrete. Horror that such murder could strike the safety of the Moscow bubble.These were all present in the horrific aftermath of Friday night’s savage attack outside Crocus City Hall\\xa0just as they were almost 22 years ago\\xa0when I was outside the Dubrovka Theatre,\\xa0where\\xa0Chechen gunmen took 800 hostages, and a standoff ended with a special forces raid.While the theatre attacks of 2002 marked just one of many horrific low points in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Islamist extremism, last night showed that the brutal past has come back to haunt the Kremlin — if, indeed, it ever left.Yet Putin faces the same sort of Islamist enemy as 2002, in a world transformed. If indeed ISIS-K —\\xa0the militant group’s Afghan branch —\\xa0were responsible, as their claim and advance warnings from US officials suggest,\\xa0it means\\xa0a new generation of extremists have Russia in their sights,\\xa0following Russia’s\\xa0bloody suppression of Islamism in\\xa0the\\xa0south.Twenty years ago, the Dubrovka gunmen were the disturbed product of Russia’s savage anti-terror campaign that summarily executed hundreds of military aged males in Chechnya in the early 2000s.Friday’s attackers likely spawned from an ideology born online, after the short-lived Caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and in the furnace of hotly-suppressed Islamism in Central Asia and Afghanistan.Two decades of state repression have not denied this new wave of anger its bloody agency. Putin’s relentless prosecution of extremism in Russia’s own North Caucasus, co-opting the brutal forces of the Kadyrov family to suppress all dissent in Chechnya, appeared to work for some years, but has not ended the problem. In some new, yet more warped form, the Islamist threat is back,\\xa0seeking to inflict pain on Russia for its misadventures and brutality in the Middle East.There is one marked difference from 20 years ago: the Russian state response.According to videos of the attack, the Crocus City gunmen appeared to run unimpeded for a significant period through a crowded Friday night mall, despite public warnings from the US to the Kremlin for weeks of a threat to public spaces.In October 2002, the Kremlin’s response was marked by callous yet effective discipline. After days of talks and waiting,\\xa0an elite\\xa0unit deployed a knock-out gas to incapacitate the entire theatre.The\\xa0likely casualty rate was apparently deemed a preferable and manageable loss, compared to the bloody alternative of a frontal assault.Authorities even let paramedics remain in the dark about the plan for increased surprise against the gunmen. It was horrific as a plan, but it worked — if keeping losses to around 15% was indeed a palatable goal.No such state control was witnessed on Friday — the gunmen apparently able to flee at first.Instead, the Kremlin\\xa0has been blaming\\xa0a warped combination of Western prescience, and Ukrainian assistance.The mere idea, stated by foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, that the gunmen sought to flee to Ukraine — through one of the most violent and militarised borders on earth — shows\\xa0a\\xa0Kremlin struggling to explain this horror, even in their own highly controlled information space.Margarita Simonyan, head of the Russia Today network and a Kremlin mouthpiece, even suggested — with no evidence at all — the ISIS gunmen are in fact Ukrainian. One senior parliamentarian also hinted that the “Ukrainian trace” in these attacks must be answered on the battlefield.\\xa0Ukraine has strenuously denied any connection with the attack.It exposes how far\\xa0adrift\\xa0and overstretched Putin now is. The safety of his muted, urban electorate in the capital has been entirely sacrificed to his war of choice in Ukraine. Special forces did not race in; they are dead, or busy elsewhere. Even some police have been deployed to the frontlines.Instead, a vast shopping centre was prey to the same terrors of 2002, the same startling security failure in the capital. After Dubrovka, critics wondered out loud how on earth a van load of armed\\xa0gunmen in fatigues could have simply driven up to a major theatre in Moscow and walked in? The same happened again, 20 years later, despite Putin’s grip now protected by a surveillance system of cameras and facial recognition he could have never dreamed possible in 2002.But he is not in control in the ways he portrays. Like with the short-lived coup by former confidant Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin’s veneer of absolute authority sometimes briefly slips and what is below is terrifyingly chaotic. There is so much the Russian system of authoritarianism cannot quash. It relies on patriarchy, fealty, corruption and a curious sense that the tsar, in this case Putin, will intervene to right palpable wrongs. But he does not. He does not always know how badly his state is functioning. And so, four young men can just roll up with automatic weapons to a vast Moscow mall and set fire to it, after shooting dozens dead.Two things will likely follow. First, there will be\\xa0further efforts\\xa0to suggest Ukraine and the West are somehow involved in these attacks. Moscow will seek to use this moment to justify its war in Ukraine as a response to a yet greater and more urgent threat to the safety of its population. Whether it is able to find a new tool in its kit to wreak revenge on its imagined culprit is unclear; Russia is already functioning at full throttle in Ukraine.The second is it will likely happen again. The Dubrovka attack was followed two years later by airplanes being blown out of the sky and the catastrophic nightmare of the Beslan school siege. Russia was seen as weak in its most sacred spaces, and more disturbed young Islamists were able to take advantage.The wider change here is in Russia’s relationship with the West. In 2002, Dubrovka forced Moscow reluctantly yet closer to the United States’ war on terror. Two decades ago, it felt the White House and the Kremlin briefly had common purpose. Now, Moscow finds itself ignoring and politicising Western intelligence warnings about an attack, it then seeks to partially blame on the West, simply because it seems to know – and warn - about the possibility of an attack in advance.Friday night’s attacks herald a new dark chapter for Putin, one that is deeply familiar to him. An enemy within that his brutal and relentless tactics cannot fully vanquish. A West that must be made a scapegoat of. And a state lacking in the basic resources to protect its softest targets.He has been here before, and the question remains, again, whether Russians are content to turn to him as their protector one more time.', 'Donald Trump’s legal team and the New York Attorney General’s office are working hard ahead of the former president’s Monday’s deadline to secure a bond for the multimillion-dollar civil fraud judgment against him.Trump personally owes over $454 million stemming from the ruling made by Judge Arthur Engoron back in February. The figure balloons up to $463.9 million when including the money owed from his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., the Trump Organization and the interest that was\\xa0accrued\\xa0as of the date of the ruling.Experts who spoke to CNN say Attorney General Letitia James and her staff should be poised to start the complicated legal maze of seizing Trump’s assets if the former president does not secure the bonds needed to cover Engoron’s ruling as he appeals.Assets, such as buildings, houses, cars, helicopters and his plane, are in play. The main focus could be on his bank accounts, which experts say will be easier to take hold of, and properties, which\\xa0would\\xa0be more difficult.Trump has asked a state appeals court to allow him to post a smaller bond – or none at all – claiming he would face irreparable harm if he were forced to sell properties at a fire sale that can’t be undone if he ultimately wins his appeal. The court has not yet ruled.Here’s what happens if Trump can’t secure the bond:In theory, officials can begin the complicated legal process of taking his assets, barring any other strategic legal maneuvering from state prosecutors and countering from Trump’s legal team.\\xa0Officials will have to weigh what assets they want to take, whether\\xa0it’s his\\xa0bank accounts or\\xa0his properties.\\xa0Experts think the first\\xa0action\\xa0should be seizing his bank accounts.“The banks are the easiest part, they’ll receive the judgment from the Attorney General - the court order - then the banks will enforce,” said attorney Peter Katz, a former federal prosecutor at the Eastern District of New York who has handled fraud cases. “They take the funds from the account and put it in the attorney general’s accounts. The other stuff is a little more challenging.”Taking money from Trump’s accounts\\xa0requires\\xa0state prosecutors\\xa0to ask\\xa0the New York City Sheriff or a US Marshall to go into the main branch of whichever bank Trump has his money, armed with a court order.“They walk in and give it to the manager,” said Adam Pollock, a former assistant New York State Attorney General who now specializes in judgment enforcement at Pollock Cohen LLP. “The manager is supposed to pay over the amount forthwith. It should be a cashier’s check.”Any\\xa0perceived extra\\xa0time taken by the attorney general’s office could be just part of determining the right strategy.“They’re trying to get their ducks in a row. They want to find the most liquid of the assets they can restrain immediately. A bank account is the most effective way to do it,” said attorney Alden B. Smith who specializes in debt collection. “They’re probably just deciding what’s the best course of action.”Seizing property takes much longer.Once state prosecutors figure out what property they want to take, they give the sheriff’s office the execution order, along with a fee for $350, Pollock said. The sheriff then posts the notice for the property in three places and the Attorney General’s office must advertise it four times, Pollack said. Then, in 63 days from when the execution order is given to the sheriff, a public auction is held for the property, according to Pollock.“They could say ‘hand over the ownership of these 500 corporations and LLC’s to the sheriff for public auction’ or just enough so that they could satisfy the judgment or $455 million worth,” Pollock said.The seizure process will be more difficult with\\xa0Trump’s out-of-state properties,\\xa0so\\xa0state prosecutors have already made some legal moves to get the ball rolling in\\xa0New York.The attorney general’s office filed judgments in Westchester County, north of New York City, in what some say is the first sign that the state is laying the groundwork to seize the former president’s golf course\\xa0in Briarcliff Manor as well as his\\xa0private estate known as Seven Springs.State lawyers entered the judgments with the clerk’s office in Westchester County on March 6, just one week after Engoron’s ruling.No other judgments have been filed, but the process could play out in other states where Trump has assets, most notably\\xa0Mar-a-Lago in Florida,\\xa0though other properties might be less challenging to take.“The attorney general’s office is the largest firm in New York State, if you think about it as a law firm. The office has zero lawyers in Florida. I would see execution on properties in New York\\xa0before you see anything in Florida, Pollack said.A key legal battle could be how much of Mar-a-Lago\\xa0is considered to be\\xa0Trump’s home, which could be protected under the law.“At the heart could be the homestead extension. But that would have to play out in court,” Pollock said.Trump is still waiting on whether an appeals court will either lessen the amount he must pay as part of\\xa0the ruling or pause the judgment all together while his appeal is being considered.If he doesn’t win his appeal, bankruptcy remains an option, albeit one the former president does not want to take.“You don’t want him to file bankruptcy, then the debt will be discharged,” Smith said. “If he files for bankruptcy then the judgment is automatically stayed. Bankruptcy is the biggest nemesis of collection enforcement\\xa0for\\xa0lawyers.”If Trump doesn’t come up with the money, his options\\xa0shrink\\xa0considerably.“I don’t see any other way he could stop the process from proceeding without going into bankruptcy or getting a bond,” Smith said.Trump and his team could sell smaller properties as a way to try and satisfy the debt.“At the end of the day, he’ll do anything before letting Tish James put on a metaphorical padlock on 40 Wall Street,” Harry Litman,\\xa0a\\xa0former deputy assistant attorney general, told CNN on Friday.While the clock is about to run out, some experts question why a grace period was even given.“There’s no reason for courtesy when he owes $455 million dollars to the people of the state of New York after being found persistently liable for fraud,” Pollock said. “That’s not someone you typically extend courtesy to.”The former president posted on Truth Social Friday he currently has almost $500 million in cash that he intended to use for his campaign and said James “wants to take it away from him.”“THROUGH HARD WORK, TALENT, AND LUCK, I CURRENTLY HAVE ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WHICH I INTENDED TO USE IN MY CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT. THE OFTEN OVERTURNED POLITICAL HACK JUDGE ON THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT A.G. CASE, WHERE I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG, KNEW THIS, WANTED TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME,” Trump posted in all caps.His attorney, Chris Kise told CNN that Trump wasn’t referring to cash he has on hand, however.“What he’s talking about is the money reported on his campaign disclosure forms that he’s built up through years of owning and managing successful businesses,” Kise told CNN on Friday. That is the very cash that Letitia James and the Democrats are targeting.”Trump also recently had to secure a nearly $92 million bond to satisfy the judgment against him in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case as he appeals.Litman told CNN that there is likely less money than Trump says because of the fraud ruling. Either way, he added, is a devastating blow for the former president.“It’s like a company that all of a sudden has no chairs, furniture, accounts receivable or anything. That is really the end of the day, I think, for the Trump organization in New York,” Litman said. “It’s an ugly, ugly situation for him, even if it is halfway accurate.”', 'The White House on Sunday attacked congressional Republicans for pushing a provision in the government funding bill that limits which flags can be flown above US embassies, effectively banning LGBTQ flags.“President Biden believes it was inappropriate to abuse the process that was essential to keep the government open by including this policy targeting LGBTQI+ Americans,” a White House spokesperson said in a statement.“While it will have no impact on the ability of members of the LGBTQI+ community to serve openly in our embassies or to celebrate Pride, the Administration fought against the inclusion of this policy and we will continue to work with members of Congress to find an opportunity to repeal it,” the spokesperson said.The White House’s criticism was reported by Bloomberg on Saturday.The measure permits only certain flags to be flown over US embassies, including the US flag, US Foreign Service flag, POW/MIA flag, Hostage and Wrongful Detainee flag, flag of a state, “insular area” or DC, Indian tribal government flag, the official branded flag of a US agency, and the sovereign flag of another nation.The provision, which was negotiated by congressional appropriators, does not include language restricting what flags can be flown elsewhere on embassy grounds or in offices.“The flag provision would continue to allow pride flags to be present in almost all cases at embassies, except flown *over* the exterior of the building. It doesn’t limit a flag on, in front of, inside, at workspaces, etc,” Human Rights Campaign spokesperson Brandon Wolf said in a statement posted on X.Wolf said the provision amounts to “spin” from Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, whom he called “desperate to appease a base whose agenda is a unmitigated disaster.”The White House spokesperson added that it was “successful” in preventing over 50 other policy provisions targeting the LGBTQ community that Republicans had sought to insert into the legislation.“President Biden is committed to fighting for LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad,” the spokesperson said..While the State Department under Donald Trump rejected requests from embassies to raise the Pride flag, Secretary of State Antony Blinken authorized US diplomatic missions to raise the flag above embassies and consulates across the world in 2021. Many US embassies fly the Pride flag during the month of June, which is recognized as Pride Month in the United States and other countries.', 'Sen. Lisa\\xa0Murkowski, aghast\\xa0at Donald Trump’s candidacy and the direction of her party, won’t rule out bolting from the GOP.The veteran Alaska Republican, one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial amid the aftermath of January 6, 2021, is done with the former president and said she “absolutely” would\\xa0not vote for him.“I wish that\\xa0as Republicans, we had … a nominee that I could get behind,” Murkowski told CNN. “I certainly can’t get behind Donald Trump.”The party’s shift toward Trump has caused\\xa0Murkowski\\xa0to consider her future within the GOP. In the interview, she would not say if she would remain a Republican.Asked if she would become an independent,\\xa0Murkowski\\xa0said: “Oh, I think I’m very independent minded.” And she added:\\xa0“I just regret that our party is seemingly becoming a party of Donald Trump.”Pressed on if that meant she might become an independent,\\xa0Murkowski\\xa0said:\\xa0“I am navigating my way through some very interesting political times. Let’s just leave it at that.”Murkowski\\xa0hasn’t always been on the outs within her party. Appointed in 2002 by her father, Gov. Frank\\xa0Murkowski, the senator’s politics were in line with the president at the time – George W. Bush – as she maintained a tight relationship with the senior GOP senator from her state, Ted Stevens, who helped build Alaska through federal dollars he funneled back home.She later found herself at odds with Sen. John McCain’s running mate, the then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who had been sharply critical of her father. As the tea party rose in 2010,\\xa0Murkowski\\xa0was at sharp odds with the insurgent right-wing of her party. She lost a primary in 2010 to Republican Joe Miller, only to later hold on to her seat after she became the second candidate ever to win a write-in campaign for Senate in the general election.Murkowski\\xa0skated to reelection in her next two elections, even after voting to convict Trump in 2021, voting against Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in 2018 and supporting Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022. She had been targeted by Trump and his allies in 2022 but was backed by Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and his high-spending outside group.In the 2024 cycle,\\xa0Murkowski\\xa0– along with Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – offered a late endorsement of former South\\xa0Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, just days before she dropped out of the race.Now, Murkowski is clear she’s ready to move past Trump. Asked about Trump’s recent comments that Jewish people who vote for Democrats must “hate” their religion,\\xa0Murkowski\\xa0said it was an “incredibly wrong and an awful statement.”And\\xa0Murkowski\\xa0pushed back when asked last week about Trump’s other controversial rhetoric, namely that he views January 6 prisoners as “hostages” and “patriots” who should be pardoned.“I don’t think that it can be defended,”\\xa0Murkowski\\xa0said. “What happened on January 6 was …\\xa0an effort by\\xa0people who stormed the building in an effort to stop an election certification of an election. It can’t be defended.”', 'In Charles Dickens’ 1850 novel “David Copperfield,” the perpetually indebted Mr. Micawber notes that all he can offer his young lodger is this advice: “Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness.”By contrast, “Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.”In that case, “the blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered,” Micawber says, “and in short you are forever floored.” Like Dickens’ own father who gave him the same advice in real life, Micawber is dragged off to debtors’ prison, but he never loses his optimism that “something will turn up.”Something may turn up for former President Donald Trump. He faces a Monday deadline to post a $464 million bond that would prevent New York Attorney General Letitia James from attempting to seize his assets while he appeals the judgment imposed on him, his sons and his companies in the civil fraud case.Trump can hope that he’ll succeed in an appeal to reduce the size of the bond, or that somehow the $3 billion he may reap from a public offering of his Truth Social platform can improve his situation, even though his stake is locked up for six months. And, in a post on Truth Social, he boasted of having nearly half a billion in ready cash to put to work in his presidential campaign, while his lawyers insist he can’t post the bond.Debtors’ prisons are a thing of the past, but the cold hard reality of finance isn’t — if your cash going out exceeds what’s coming in, you have to borrow money, or sell something.Money has always been integral to the Trump brand, starting decades before he played a billionaire on “The Apprentice.” Trump’s 1987 bestseller “The Art of the Deal”, written with Tony Schwartz, begins, “I don’t do it for the money. I’ve got enough, much more than I’ll ever need. … Deals are my art form.”Having a lot of money distinguished him from other presidential candidates, Trump contended. “Boasting, as he always has, of being fabulously rich, he told the 2016 voters that his campaign, unlike that of his rival, was\\xa0completely self-funded,” Frida Ghitis wrote. “That wasn’t true, of course, but his argument was actually correct. Nobody would control him, he claimed, because those who give you money expect something in return. ‘I don’t need anybody’s money,’\\xa0Trump\\xa0said\\xa0in his June 2015\\xa0presidential campaign\\xa0announcement.”“Now Trump needs money, a lot of it. What would his creditors or benefactors want in return?…“In addition to nearly half a billion dollars in judgments, Trump faces massive legal fees over multiple civil and criminal cases, and his presidential campaign funds, drained after\\xa0funding his personal legal costs, are badly lagging behind President Joe Biden’s\\xa0massive war chest.”“Anyone who thinks America’s foes are not paying attention to what could become an entry gate for a Trojan Horse is suffering from wishful thinking.”As Julian Zelizer noted, “The problem for Trump is that as his legal expenses and obligations are piling up, his fundraising efforts have been lagging. His leadership political action committee, Save America, spent nearly $5.6 million in legal fees in February alone.\\xa0 And while the super PAC Maga Inc. has refunded nearly all of that money, that’s money that could have been used for Trump’s campaign.”“It doesn’t help that there is a growing fundraising gap between Trump and Biden. Right now, President Biden’s campaign coffers are overflowing. … In a campaign where a relatively small percentage of swing voters in a handful of states will likely determine the outcome, turnout and advertising buys will have an outsized impact. Biden’s financial strength has allowed his campaign to unleash a torrent of blistering ads in swing states, targeting core voters such as Latinos.”Trump faces trial in a New York courtroom next month over a $130,000 “hush money” payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. In a new documentary on Peacock, Ana Marie Cox wrote, Daniels tells her story. Raised by her mother in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, “she began her career as a stripper at the age of 17, acted in her first adult film in 2002 and soon branched into writing and directing. In July 2006, she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament and says that the two had sex that weekend. Trump has denied\\xa0being sexually involved with Daniels…”“As an adult filmmaker, Daniels probably understands objectification better than most and she’s used every tool at her disposal to move from object to subject\\xa0in this scenario. This is a story about her, and not what Trump did to her. Daniels’ greatest contribution to the movement against Trump is her commitment to her own humanity. In the face of dehumanization, staying true to ourselves is the most powerful statement in the world.”Trump’s former trade adviser, Peter Navarro, began a four-month prison sentence last week for contempt of Congress. He’s not the first Trump associate to go behind bars, SE Cupp pointed out. “Indeed, working for Donald Trump seems to come with some serious personal and professional liability – expect to lawyer up, expect to have to lie for him, expect to have to cover his tracks,” she said.After months of negotiations and intraparty squabbles, Speaker Mike Johnson did last week what his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy did when he was nominally in charge of the House Republicans — rely on votes from Democrats to pass spending bills. Following in Rep. Matt Gaetz’ footsteps, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust Johnson, though it’s unclear if it will come to a vote.For more:Paul Sracic: What the Ohio GOP primary means for Trump.Fareed Zakaria: Why a booming economy isn’t helping BidenISIS claimed responsibility for a terror attack at a Moscow-area concert venue, killing at least 133 people. If ISIS was indeed behind the attack, it would represent another sign of the group’s return from oblivion, after losing its “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria and devolving into a loosely allied group of affiliates, Peter Bergen wrote.“ISIS-K certainly has the capability and motive to attack Russia. When it comes to motive, the\\xa0Russian support for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, which helped him remain in power during the Syrian civil war, certainly comes to mind. For ISIS, Assad is a mortal enemy, both because he is a member of a Shia sect and because he has systematically killed Sunnis in Syria.“Also, historically, Russia has brutally repressed Muslim minorities like the Chechens.\\xa0As for capability, the ISIS-K attack in Iran earlier this year demonstrated that the group could carry out a large-scale attack outside of its home base in Afghanistan.” Bergen noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly castigated the US for its warning on March 7 of extremists having “imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow.”Boeing, one of the two major passenger aircraft makers in the world, is struggling to right itself. “The situation at Boeing is grim,” wrote aviation consultant Richard Aboulafia. “Serious program execution problems and high-profile safety incidents, with still-fresh memories of the two\\xa0737\\xa0MAX disasters\\xa0in\\xa02018 and 2019, are damaging the company’s brand and bringing increased regulatory scrutiny. Its recovery won’t begin until management starts examining how the company got here.”“Years ago, an excessive focus on financial returns led Boeing to badly neglect two of its greatest resources: its people and its suppliers,” he noted.While shareholders and senior executives benefited from stock dividends, buybacks and stock-based compensation, “the result of this strategy is plain to see: an under-resourced supply chain, and an equally under-resourced and badly alienated workforce. These have resulted in\\xa0missed production targets, serious\\xa0program delays,\\xa0failed safety audits\\xa0and embarrassing instances of\\xa0shoddy workmanship…”“All is not lost. Boeing still has good people, impressive technologies and great jetliners. The latter are\\xa0in a duopoly with very high entry barriers, even if Airbus is quickly gaining market share. All that’s needed is a new approach to management at the top.”Another major American business, Joann Fabrics and Crafts, filed for bankruptcy last week. Lynda Gorov, descended from a family of Russian-Ukrainian tailors, said the outcome may have been inevitable given shifts in our society, but it’s still a shame. Joann, “founded 81 years ago when my seamstress grandmothers still had young children at home, blamed a post-pandemic sales slump for the downturn. The lockdown saw\\xa0sales of sewing machines\\xa0soar and stock sell out. But now that we’re not making our own face masks, or\\xa0working from home\\xa0in nearly the same numbers, many of our DIY urges are apparently on the wane.”“But it’s more than that. … crafting skills used to be commonplace. Parents passed them down and when\\xa0Silent Generation\\xa0or early Boomer parents could not or did not, home economics teachers did. Most people (OK, most women) who attended public junior high schools in the 1960s,\\xa01970s or even\\xa01980s learned at least basic sewing skills and could advance them with elective classes in high school. Boys were welcome to attend, too, although I don’t recall any wearing aprons or thimbles alongside me.”With the rise of fast fashion, “it can be far cheaper and far, far less time consuming to run to the mall and grab something off the rack for yourself or your child than it is to set up the sewing machine and do it yourself. Add up the hours spent knitting a scarf or crocheting a sweater, never mind the cost of materials, and homemade items have become the luxuries and store-bought ones the bargain. Most people I know don’t even mend anymore (and shame on us).”Catherine, the Princess of Wales, revealed Friday that she has been diagnosed with cancer, ending months of public speculation about her medical condition.“I felt a deep and traumatic solidarity,” wrote Sara Stewart, a cancer survivor. “Recovering from major abdominal surgery — as Kate has been since January — is ghastly, and having to do it so you can be healthy enough for chemotherapy is a humbling one-two punch from the universe. For Kate, that’s topped off by having to endure it all while the entire world chases you down like a fox on one of those hunts the royals are always throwing…”“Although I cannot stress enough that she owes absolutely nothing to the public while she goes through treatment, my fervent hope is that once she’s on the other side of it she’ll become a powerful voice advocating for more ways of early testing and destigmatization.”For a few hours last week, Texas was able to control its own immigration policy, despite more than a century in which the federal government has had sole authority to regulate America’s borders. After the US Supreme Court cleared the way for a controversial Texas law go into effect, a three-judge appeals court panel put the law on hold while it faces a challenge from the Biden administration.“Whatever the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court decide next, the question for President Joe Biden is what to do now,” wrote Lawrence Downes.“Biden is the one who has been vilified for not stopping what (Texas Gov. Greg) Abbott, former President Donald Trump and others falsely call an immigrant ‘invasion.’ Despite his\\xa0low approval rating on the issue,\\xa0Biden remains the one who is actually responsible for immigration policy while demagogues like Abbott and Trump denigrate immigrants with\\xa0violent\\xa0and\\xa0dehumanizing language\\xa0and whip themselves and the public into a nativist frenzy.”“If Texas is going to act this way,” Downes added, “Biden should step up and surge resources to the border — not more troops, but Department of Justice investigators and civil-rights lawyers, to be ready to defend immigrants and brown-skinned Texans (and Arizonans and New Mexicans passing through) against the profiling and other civil-rights violations that are sure to follow in SB 4’s wake. He should do more to protect asylum seekers at the southern border, who deserve safety and due process.”At a Harvard event last month, Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser Jared Kushner remarked that Gaza could have “very valuable” waterfront property and suggested that the people sheltering in the Southern city of Rafah, estimated at 1.4 million, could be moved into Egypt or into Israel’s Negev desert.“Kushner’s\\xa0notions are fantasies,” wrote Peter Bergen, “since the Egyptians are not going to accept substantial numbers of Palestinian refugees, let alone the more than one million sheltering in Rafah, something they have\\xa0made clear repeatedly.\\xa0Nor is Israel going to accommodate them.”“The October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel were inexcusable, and Israel had every right to avenge them,” Bergen noted.“Still, Palestinian rage has been\\xa0building for years, and Kushner, as then-President Donald Trump’s\\xa0shadow secretary of\\xa0state, helped contribute to this, something Kushner seems to be blissfully unaware of.”Writing from Rafah, journalist Aseel Mousa observed, “After narrowly escaping death in Gaza City and Al-Maghazi, I’m unsure if I’ll survive in Rafah. If we are to avoid total catastrophe, Biden and the international community must act immediately to prevent a full-scale Israeli invasion of Rafah and to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid to enter.”By settling a lawsuit, the National Association of Realtors has effectively conceded that the 5-6% commission that agents get from home sellers is no longer sacrosanct. But as sociologist Max Besbris pointed out, that doesn’t mean those rates, which are considerably higher than in many other countries, will go down quickly.“It is clear that more consumer knowledge and more oversight are both necessary,” Besbris wrote. “It should become standard that agents both in writing and verbally alert new clients that fees are legally negotiable. We need stronger and more expansive training for licensed real estate agents, particularly around their financial and fair-housing obligations, as well as more data collection on real estate agent practices.”In a divided world, it’s noteworthy when the 193 member states in the United Nations General Assembly can agree on anything. As US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield wrote, the assembly adopted a US-backed resolution Thursday to create a global approach to living with AI.“The resolution passed\\xa0Thursday\\xa0provides a framework to address challenges head on, with a focus on capacity-building to ensure equitable access to the benefits of AI, and equitable cover from its harms. It lays out the steps countries can take to ensure responsible governance, and protect all individuals — including vulnerable individuals — from discrimination, as well as the ways in which the United Nations itself can use AI to advance human rights and sustainable development.”“Now comes the hard work of putting those principles not only to paper, but into practice.”\\xa0Sixty five years ago, Thomas-Greenfield noted, former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was shown a machine that could play checkers. She “asked ‘coming generations’ to consider what makes us human, and what it means to interact with new and powerful technology. Today, as we celebrate a milestone in realizing the potential of artificial intelligence, it is not on ‘coming generations,’ but\\xa0this\\xa0generation, to continue answering her call — together.”Grace Elizabeth Hale: Mississippi ‘Goon Squad’ has a frightening historyElizabeth Yuko: The revolutionary sickle cell therapiesRabbi Avi Weiss: Why antisemitism and anti-Zionism are so deeply intertwinedJennifer Jones: Free-speech cases shouldn’t neuter critical power of the government’s voiceJill Filipovic: No one knows the real Christine Blasey FordDerrick Johnson: For Black college athletes, this is the bus boycott of our eraPeter Rutland: ‘The Zone of Interest’ — a Holocaust movie without JewsHolly Thomas: Lily Allen said having children ruined her career.

I want to thank you for your trust. And I want to promise and pledge to you today that I will repay that trust with hard work with blood, sweat and tears, day in and day out with responsibility, with humility, and with civility,” he said.Harris also paid tribute to Varadkar for his “incredible leadership.”“Each and every time he [Varadkar] delivered, whether it was the existential threats of Brexit and COVID or his contribution to key moments of social change in this country. I know and believe his legacy is significant since 2010,” said Harris.Harris had been serving as Ireland’s minister for further and higher education. He also served as the country’s health minister from May 2016 to June 2020, according to Fine Gael’s website.', 'Ukraine says it hit two Russian naval vessels, along with a communications center and several other facilities belonging to the Black Sea Fleet, in a huge overnight attack on the Crimean port of Sevastopol.There has been no comment from Russian defense officials, although Russian politician and Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhayev acknowledged on his Telegram channel that it was the “most massive attack in recent times.”A video posted to a local Telegram channel shows a series of large explosions in the city, sending fireballs and thick black smoke into the air. Another fireball can be seen in the far distance.Ukraine said the vessels hit were two amphibious landing ships, the Yamal and the Azov. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear.Hailing the attacks, Ukrainian air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk wrote on social media, “The sky and the sea are of the same color! I thank the pilots and navy for their successful combat work! Crimea is ours! To the victory together!”Making no reference to any military sites hit, Razvozhayev said one person had been killed in the attack. Maritime and ground transportation in the city, he said, had been “partially damaged.”Elsewhere in Crimea, Russian military bloggers say Ukrainian forces also targeted sites in the west and the center of the illegally-annexed peninsular, including at Hvardiiske, which lies just north of Crimea’s administrative center, Simferopol. Users posting video to a local Telegram channel have suggested an oil depot there was attacked.CNN is unable to immediately verify the latest claims by either side.While Moscow appears clearly to have the upper hand in its ground campaign, Kyiv’s forces have enjoyed sustained successes targeting Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, in either missile strikes or sea drone attacks.More than 20 Russian naval vessels have now been disabled or destroyed, a third of the entire fleet. Though Ukraine has virtually no navy of its own,\\xa0technological innovation, audacity and Russian incompetence have given it the upper hand in much of the Black Sea. In October last year, satellite imagery indicated that Russia relocated some of its naval ships away from Sevastopol after a series of Ukrainian attacks.If Sunday’s strikes on the Yamal and Azov are confirmed, it would likely mean Russia had only three working landing ships left in the Black Sea. Ukraine says Moscow began the full-scale invasion with 13 such vessels.In September, a Ukrainian missile strike also destroyed the fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol.For Ukraine, the impact is not just military but also economic, because it helps to secure a shipping corridor from Odesa and other ports towards the Bosphorus Strait, allowing Ukraine to sell grain and other products on world markets.', 'Heath Barnes opened his book on the upper decks of the Bahamas-bound Carnival Freedom cruise ship in between bouts of rain.But his relaxation Saturday afternoon was suddenly stolen with “the loudest thunder and lightning I have ever heard,” he told CNN.Barnes, of Woodsboro, Maryland, went back inside and minutes later learned from his nephew and his nephew’s two friends, all 16, the ship was on fire.“I thought they were giving me a hard time, but I got up and went out on the balcony and sure enough, the flames and smoke was pouring out of the tail,” said Barnes, who shared footage of the incident with CNN.Cruise ship officials reported the fire broke out on the port side of the ship’s exhaust funnel around 3:15 p.m. local time, according to a news release from Carnival Cruise Line.Witnesses reported the ship may have been struck by lightning, but that has not been confirmed and the cause is still being investigated, according to the cruise line.As the ship’s fire response team worked to extinguish the blaze, the cruise’s captain turned the ship toward an area of heavy rain to help put out the flames, the release states.The fire appeared to be extinguished about two hours after it ignited. There were no reported injuries to guests, but two firefighting crew members were treated for minor smoke inhalation, according to the cruise line.The port side portion of the exhaust funnel fell onto deck 10 of the ship as a result of the fire, according to Carnival.The ship was about 20 miles off Eleuthera Island, Bahamas, when the fire broke out. The blaze started as the ship headed to Freeport, the release said.The cruise line said passengers were able to attend dinner as planned Saturday night.The US Coast Guard has been notified about the incident.Barnes said after the fire broke out, passengers were told to remain in their cabins until about 5:40 p.m.This was his 18th Carnival Cruise trip.“This was the most interesting one,” he said. “It’s not their fault, it’s Mother Nature.”Carnival said later on Sunday it had completed a thorough assessment during the ship’s visit to Freeport and discovered the damage was worse than the cruise line initially reported.The Carnival Freedom cruise trips originally scheduled to depart from Port Canaveral, Florida, on March 25 and March 29 have been canceled to allow “immediate repair to stabilize the funnel,” the cruise line said in a news release.“The funnel has been stabilized for the ship’s return to Port Canaveral overnight to disembark guests, and then it will go to the Freeport shipyard on Monday afternoon to begin the required repairs,” according to the updated release.Carnival announced full refunds and future cruise credits for passengers scheduled to depart on the canceled cruises.', 'Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday defended accusing Israel of genocide against the Palestinian people and advocating for cuts to US military aid until humanitarian relief flows freely in Gaza. Her decision to use the term genocide, as she did during a floor speech on Friday in the House chamber, was “taken with extraordinary gravity,” she said.While she has openly condemned the violence in Gaza amid Israel’s war against Hamas, Ocasio-Cortez has typically been cautious about labeling Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians as genocide — a distinction in line with her tendency to use more conciliatory rhetoric on Israel than some of her ideological allies. But the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza has “crossed the threshold of intent,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”“As we speak, in this moment, 1.1 million innocents in Gaza are at famine’s door,” Ocasio-Cortez said in her speech Friday. “A famine that is being intentionally precipitated through the blocking of food and global humanitarian assistance by leaders in the Israeli government.”“If you want to know what an unfolding genocide looks like,” the New York Democrat added, “open your eyes.”More than 32,000 people in the coastal enclave have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war began, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.All 2.2 million people in Gaza do not have enough food to eat, with half of the population on the brink of starvation and famine projected to arrive in the north “anytime between mid-March and May 2024,” according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.“What we are seeing here, I think, with a forced famine is beyond our ability to deny or explain away,” Ocasio-Cortez told Tapper. “There is no targeting of Hamas in precipitating a mass famine of a million people, half of whom are children.”Her comments come as the Biden administration is hardening its stance ahead of key meetings this week between US and Israeli officials.Vice President Kamala Harris said Sunday that the US would not rule out consequences for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government if he moves forward with a military offensive in Rafah, where more than a million people are crammed into a sprawling tent city,\\xa0describing such a decision as a “mistake.”“We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake. Let me tell you something, I have studied the maps. There’s nowhere for those folks to go,” she said on ABC’s “This Week.”Harris’ remarks come as national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are set to meet at the White House on Monday. They are expected to focus on continued efforts to get the remaining hostages held by Hamas released and the urgent need for more humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza.Based on recent negotiations, Israel agreed to a US “bridging proposal” on the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released for every hostage held by Hamas, and the delegations are now waiting for a response from Hamas, CNN analyst Barak Ravid said Saturday on X, citing an unnamed senior Israeli official.A diplomatic source briefed on the matter confirmed to CNN the accuracy of the information but said outstanding issues remain, including the entry of aid and “Israeli military repositioning” in Gaza.The meeting between\\xa0Sullivan\\xa0and\\xa0Gallant, a White House official told CNN, is different from the previously reported visit between Israeli officials and US officials also set for this week, at which the two countries are likely to discuss alternatives to a ground offensive of Rafah.Ocasio-Cortez told Tapper on Sunday that she disagrees with the Israeli government restricting the flow of food and aid until Hamas frees the hostages and lays down arms.“We are talking about famine,” she said. “The actions of Hamas should not be tied to whether a 3-year-old can eat. The actions of Hamas do not justify forcing thousands, hundreds of thousands of people to eat grass as their bodies consume themselves. We and the Israeli government have the right to go after Hamas. But we are talking about population of millions of innocent Palestinians. We’re talking about collective punishment, which is in unjustifiable,” she said.', 'Israeli forces have surrounded two more hospitals in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said, describing intense shelling and heavy gunfire.Months into the conflict, fighting is still raging across Gaza, despite international pressure on Israel and ongoing efforts for a ceasefire and hostage deal.The PRCS said Sunday that Al-Amal Hospital and Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza were both encircled.“All our teams are in extreme danger at the moment and are unable to move at all. They are also unable to bury the body of our colleague Amir Abu Aisha inside the hospital courtyard.”CNN has reached out to hospital authorities for more detail and to the Israel Defense Forces for a response. Both hospitals were surrounded by Israeli forces for prolonged spells earlier this year.The Israeli military is still operating at Al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest, after raiding it earlier in the week.IDF troops “apprehended approximately 480 terrorists affiliated with the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations, and have located weapons and terrorist infrastructure in the hospital,” the IDF said in an update Sunday.The IDF also announced that one a soldier had been killed in a battle in northern Gaza, bringing the death toll among soldiers since the ground operation began is 252.At least 32,226 people in Gaza have died since the October 7 attacks, with almost 75,000 injured, the Gaza Ministry of health said.In January, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced that the most intensive phase of operations in northern Gaza was complete, but in recent weeks the IDF has returned in force to the area around Al-Shifa as Hamas appears to have built up its presence and operations in the area.On Monday, the IDF launched a fresh operation at Al Shifa after claiming that “senior Hamas terrorists” were using the facility. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said about 3,000 people were seeking refuge and that those attempting to leave were being targeted by snipers and fire from helicopters.Hamas accused Israel of striking targets “without regard” to the patients or medical staff inside – a claim echoed by people at the complex.Hospitals have been battlegrounds throughout the conflict. Israel has accused Gazan medical facilities of harbouring Hamas fighters and weapons, something denied by doctors and the militant group.UN Secretary General\\xa0António Guterres, meanwhile warned that “horror and starvation” was stalking Gaza, calling for a ceasefire and the immediate release of hostages.Guterres, who visited the Egyptian border on Saturday, has also called the relief trucks mounting there “a moral outrage,” urging Israel to allow “total, unfettered access for humanitarian goods throughout Gaza.”His remarks sparked anger from Israel, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz saying that the UN had become “an antisemitic and anti-Israeli body that shelters and emboldens terror” under Guterres’ leadership.Katz, in a\\xa0statement on X, accused\\xa0Guterres\\xa0of criticizing Israel without condemning “in any way” the Hamas “terrorists who plunder humanitarian aid, without condemning UNRWA that cooperates with terrorists – and without calling for the immediate, unconditional release of all Israeli hostages.”Israel and the UN’s relations are poor. The UN has been a strong critic of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, while Israel has accused some UN staffers of involvement in the October 7 attacks.', 'Poland has demanded an explanation from Moscow after saying a Russian cruise missile aimed at Ukraine entered its territory.“On March 24 at 4:23 a.m., there was a violation of Polish airspace by one of the cruise missiles launched tonight by the long-range aviation of the Russian Federation,” the Operational Command of the Polish armed forces said on X.“The object flew into Polish [air]space near the village of Oserdow (Lublin Voivodeship) and spent 39 seconds in it,” Operational Command said. “It was observed by military radar systems throughout its flight.”The report came after Ukrainian officials said Russia had launched about 20 missiles and seven Shahed attack drones targeting the western Ukrainian region of Lviv, which is near the Polish border. There were also multiple explosions reported in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.The head of the Lviv regional military administration, Maksym Kozytskyi, said that Russia hit Ukrainian critical infrastructure in the western Lviv region.“Preliminarily, there were two hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the invaders had targeted overnight,” Kozytskyi said on Telegram.Operational Command said on X that both Polish and allied aircraft had been activated.“All necessary procedures to ensure the security of Polish airspace have been activated,” the Command added.“The Polish Military is continuously monitoring the situation on Ukrainian territory and remains on constant alert to ensure the safety of Polish airspace,” it said.The last time Russia violated Poland’s airspace was on December 29, 2023. The Polish military said at the time “an unidentified airborne object” had entered its airspace from Ukrainian territory, and later Poland’s most senior military officer said “all indications” suggested it was a Russian missile.Poland’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Pawel Wronski, said in a statement on Sunday that the country called on Russia “to stop terrorist attacks from the air on the residents and territory of Ukraine, and to end the war and deal with the country’s internal problems.”Meanwhile, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that a series of blasts had occurred in the Ukrainian capital, with missile fragments falling in the Desnianskyi district.“Explosions in the capital. Air defense is active. Do not leave your shelters,” Klitschko said.He added that fire and rescue units were heading to the scene.This is a developing story and will be updated.', 'UFC fighter Igor Severino was disqualified from his fight on Saturday night after biting his opponent, Andre Lima.In the second round of their flyweight bout in Las Vegas, Lima was being held from behind by Severino before the 20-year-old appeared to lean in and bite Lima on his left arm.Lima let out an audible shout before referee Chris Tognoni stopped the fight and announced that Severino had been disqualified from the fight, awarding the win to Lima.Lima posed for photos after his victory, with a bite mark visible on his left arm.According to martial arts journalist Kevin Iole, UFC president Dana White said in a text message that Severino had been released from the organization following the disqualification.“Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters,” White said, according to Iole.“If you get frustrated and want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to do it, but the worst thing you can do is bite your opponent.“Now you get cut and lose the biggest opportunity of your life. Not to mention, he’s going to have real problems with the NSAC (Nevada State Athletic Commission).”Lima didn’t appear too bothered by the incident though, posting on Instagram in the hours after his fight that he had got a tattoo of the bite to commemorate it. The tattoo is in the same location as the original bite and appears to recreate the bitemarks left on his arm from Severino.White appeared impressed by Lima’s tattoo, posting on his Instagram story that he would double the Brazilian’s fight bonus to $50,000, saying: “This is AWESOME.”The UFC’s own social media accounts humorously commemorated the moment, coining Lima’s fight the “bite of the night,” a play on their more traditional “fight of the night” accolade.“I was able to hit him really hard, but then he bit me when I was trying to take him down. That’s why I yelled,” Lima said in the octagon after his fight.It was an unconventional way for Lima to earn his first UFC victory as he was making his debut in the competition on Saturday.He remains undefeated in his MMA career, while the disqualification is Severino’s first defeat.', 'Israel agreed to a US proposal\\xa0on a prisoner-hostage exchange\\xa0that would release around 700 Palestinian prisoners, among them 100 serving life sentences for killing Israeli nationals,\\xa0in exchange for the release of 40 Israeli hostages, CNN affiliate Kan\\xa0News reported Sunday, citing a senior Israeli official.Earlier in the weekend, CNN analyst Barak Ravid, citing an unnamed Israeli official, tweeted that Israel agreed to a US “bridging proposal” on the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released for every hostage held by Hamas.Israel agreed to the proposal put forth by CIA Director Bill Burns, according to Ravid. Burns was in Doha, Qatar, where Hamas and Israel are engaged in talks through mediators.The delegations are now waiting for a Hamas response, Ravid said.A diplomatic source briefed on the matter confirmed to CNN the accuracy of Ravid’s information but said outstanding issues remain, including the entry of aid and “Israeli military repositioning” in Gaza.CNN has reached out to Israeli officials and Hamas on the status of the talks.The latest proposal by Hamas this month demanded that some 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners be released. Israel at the time described the demands as “ridiculous” and “absurd.”Kan News reported that, according to the official, Israel is ready to make “significant compromises in order to return the abductees home.”An agreement, if it happens, is expected to have multiple phases.

Each recovered piece is a little clue that often leads to a bigger enigma that begs to be solved.For example, construction workers recently unearthed a nearly 2,000-year-old statue while building a parking lot in the United Kingdom. First, one of the crew found a marble head of a Roman lady, and two weeks later its bust surfaced nearby,\\xa0reuniting the pieces.But how did the statue, likely bought by the ninth Earl of Exeter in the 1700s for his country estate Burghley House, end up buried outside? Until additional evidence turns up, it’s a “complete mystery,” according to the estate.These historical ties allow us to find common ground with humans who lived millennia ago. And sometimes, an entire place can be found frozen in time, upending the way we understand everyday life as it occurred centuries ago.Must Farm was a thriving Bronze Age stilt village, perched above a river in eastern England, when it burned down 2,850 years ago — just nine months after its inhabitants had built it.The site, acclaimed by experts as “Britain’s Pompeii,” preserved rare information that reveals a new, less hierarchical portrait of Bronze Age society. The excavation of Must Farm (above) took place in 2016.Extensive research near Peterborough uncovered remarkably well-preserved slices of life, including a\\xa0spoon abandoned in a half-eaten bowl of porridge, along with other artifacts such as wooden buckets and ceramics.“One of those buckets … on the bottom of it were loads and loads of cut marks so we know that people living in that Bronze Age kitchen when they needed an impromptu chopping board, were just flipping that bucket upside down,” said Chris Wakefield, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge.When paleontologists decided to take a closer look at a tiny, 270 million-year-old amphibian skull tucked away in a fossil collection, they\\xa0made a bit of a rainbow connection to Kermit the Frog.The fossil, with its wide eyes and a cartoonish grin, bore such a striking resemblance to Jim Henson’s beloved Muppets character that the newly identified species now has the name Kermitops gratus.The slightly crushed skull sat unstudied in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History for 40 years before researchers examined it. And the specimen might help researchers solve an evolutionary puzzle about early amphibians that lived before the dinosaurs.Astronomers have spied two streams of ancient stars that likely helped build the Milky Way galaxy billions of years ago.The scientists discovered the stellar wonders using the European Space Agency’s Gaia space telescope, which enabled them to conduct a bit of “galactic archaeology” within the heart of our home galaxy.Named Shakti and Shiva for Hindu deities, the streams were likely parts of other galaxies that merged with the Milky Way in its infancy between 12 billion and 13 billion years ago.Speaking of stars, NASA expects a violent outburst called a nova to cause a\\xa0“new star” to appear in the night sky\\xa0anytime between now and September.When a supervolcano erupted 74,000 years ago, it likely triggered climate change that could be felt by early humans in Africa.Initially, researchers thought the eruption might have been severe enough to trigger a volcanic winter, which could have wiped out many of our ancient ancestors.Microscopic fragments of volcanic glass found alongside stone tools and animal remains near Ethiopia’s Shinfa River showed how humans survived — and adapted — after the eruption.Now, a new analysis has revealed that arid conditions caused by the cataclysmic event could have inspired a\\xa0pivotal time when humanity migrated from Africa\\xa0to live around the world.Giant pandas have distinctive patterns, but it turns out not all of them are black-and-white.A rare handful of bears sporting brown-and-white fur inhabit a single mountain range in China.With only 11 reported sightings of the creatures in Shaanxi province’s Qinling Mountains since a ranger first spotted one in 1985, researchers thought the unusual coloration was the result of inbreeding.By studying pandas in the wild and in captivity, including a male brown panda named Qizai, researchers discovered that a recessive genetic trait — much like those for blue eyes or red hair in humans — is behind the brown fur.You may do a double take after reading these stories:— About 25 million years ago, an evolutionary shift involving a “jumping gene” occurred that caused great apes and, ultimately, humans to lose their tails.— A 4,000-year-old stone vial found in southeastern Iran is\\xa0likely the oldest known tube of red lipstick.— Despite a faulty metal detector, a treasure hunter found the\\xa0largest gold nugget\\xa0ever believed to have been recovered in England.— An\\xa0unusual horned “devil comet”\\xa0will be visible in the sky during the total solar eclipse, but experts suggest keeping an eye out for it through the end of March instead.', 'Trying to imagine fat, fuzzy white lambs, jumping one by one over a fence, is a well-known remedy for sleeplessness. When I used to try this, I would insert a dapper black sheep with a red bow tie now and again — a nod to my inner rebel.I don’t have insomnia often (thank heavens), but I’ve often wondered just who came up with such a silly suggestion. If the idea is to bore yourself to sleep, why not count backward as you do when undergoing anesthesia? And who decided on sheep? Why not jackrabbits, horses, giant toads or kangaroos?History supposedly provides the answer: It was said to be a way for medieval shepherds, devoid of human company for weeks at a time, to fall asleep each night — they counted their sheep until drowsy. Whether that’s true or not, I don’t know.What is clear is that the concept of counting sheep to sleep is so old it was mentioned in a 13th century compilation of short stories titled “Cento Novelle Antiche.” In one of the novellas, a storyteller in the service of Messer Azzolino was so sleepy that he told his master a tale of a farmer trying to get a flock of sheep across a swollen river in a small boat.“So he jumped in with a single fleece, and began to row with all his might,” the storyteller said. “The river was broad, but he rowed and he rowed away. …”The storyteller stopped talking as he fell asleep, prompting his master to prod him awake to finish the tale.“Let him get over the remainder of the sheep, and then I will proceed; for it will take him a year at least, and in the meantime your excellency may enjoy a very comfortable slumber,” the fabulist replied before nodding off again.The same tale was told in the earlier 12th century work “Disciplina Clericalis,” and even became part of the 17th century book “Don Quixote” — only in this version Quixote’s squire, Sancho Panza,\\xa0tells him to count goats, not sheep.“You’d better keep track of how many goats the shepherd carries across, your grace, because if we forget a single one that will be the end of the story, and it won’t be possible to tell another word,” Panza tells him.So does counting sheep really help you fall asleep? Search online, and you’ll soon find stories about a 2002 study on combating insomnia that put the concept to the test.In reality, that wasn’t the point of the research, said senior author Allison Harvey, a professor of psychology and director of the Golden Bear Sleep and\\xa0Mood Research Clinic at the University of California,\\xa0Berkeley.“Our study more than 20 years ago wasn’t about counting sheep; it was just about using imagery to fight insomnia,” said Harvey, who conducted the research while a professor of psychology at Oxford University.Her research split 50 people into three groups, Harvey said. The first had no instructions on how to fall asleep, while members of the second were told to distract from thoughts, worries and concerns in any way they wanted. The third group was instructed to perform an interesting and engaging imagery task, such as creating or remembering a meadow, a waterfall, a holiday or a summer afternoon in the sun.Those who used imagery reported falling asleep much faster than either of the two other groups, and they rated their thoughts, worries and concerns to be less uncomfortable and distressing than people in the distraction or no instruction group.As it happened, two of the study participants in the distraction group did count sheep as a way to fall asleep “and somehow people latched onto that, I guess because they thought it was fun,” Harvey said.While she didn’t actually study counting sheep as a way of overcoming insomnia (and isn’t aware of any other studies to do so), Harvey does have an opinion based on her years as a sleep specialist.“Something as mundane as counting sheep usually does not do the trick,” she said. “Instead, we work out a menu of options with people, because everyone is different and not one option is going to help every single time.”There are science-backed ways to help yourself empty your mind and fall asleep, however. More than 20 years later, using your imagination still remains a top tip, Harvey said. Here are her other recommendations.Visualize relaxation: Envisioning a pleasant and engaging environment does work for many people and is most successful when all five senses are involved.“Try to make your image as vivid as possible by asking yourself what you see, what you hear, what you smell, and if it applies, what you taste,” she said.Gratitude: Known for boosting happiness, counting your blessings is also a good way to relax and sleep, according to research.Harvey suggests coming up with three things in your life that you are grateful for and then saying those to yourself before sleep.Savoring: A cousin of gratitude, savoring is about reliving a wonderful moment from your day. Remember what happened, how you felt and let yourself bask in those good feelings to encourage sleep, Harvey said.The next three suggestions are best done before your head hits the pillow, and all focus on controlling worry and rumination (which is chewing on repetitive thoughts much like a cow chews cud).Problem-solving: Find a time before you hit the sack to pick up a pen or pencil and make two columns on a sheet of paper. Label the top of one column “Concerns” and the other “Solutions.”List your problems or worrisome tasks in the concerns side and then brainstorm some potential fixes. Getting it down on paper frees your mind from chewing on it (so to speak).Journaling: Keeping a diary or journal doesn’t have to focus on problem-solving, although it could, Harvey said. It can be a place to capture blessings and daily memories that you want to retrieve later — or just a way of expressing yourself.Worry time: Not a writer by nature? Well, you can set aside a few hours before bed to just worry away and (hopefully) come up with solutions. Doing so can get it out of your head before your head hits the pillow, allowing sleep to come without counting sheep.', 'Bring up installing a bidet to the average American before the pandemic, and they might have likely flushed the idea straightaway.The bathroom washer business, once a foreign concept to many in the US, experienced a huge boom during the Covid-19 pandemic, when shoppers were battling over toilet paper shortages. But while some products or industries saw a boom during Covid that later came back down to earth –- say, masks, roller skates, pet adoptions, Zoom subscriptions, Peloton bikes -–\\xa0bidets made a big splash and have managed to maintain sales growth.Bidets and their product cousins – washlets, “bum guns” and other water-based alternatives to toilet paper – are universal in most parts of the world; bidet enthusiasts tout how the devices are more sustainable, clean, and less abrasive. But Americans just can’t seem to let go of the Charmin Bear. It took a toilet paper shortage for some to come around to the 18th-century invention.During the pandemic, every single bidet sold out at bidetking.com, and the business grew exponentially, bidetking.com founder James Lin said.The site faced a massive supply crunch, and it had to air freight costly containers to meet demands. Lin described shipments of products from abroad by water completely selling out before they even hit the warehouse.By some estimates, the entire bidet market grew two to three times during 2020. Tushy, which makes a trendy bidet seat attachment, pulled in a revenue of $40 million in 2020 versus $8 million in 2019, founder Miki Agrawal said to CNN.Americans are still intrigued by the bidet. Bidetking.com reports sales have grown a minimum of 20% each year since the pandemic, with 2023 closer to 30%.A dizzying array of bidet options confront the burgeoning American consumer. Big spenders can find luxury options to give their porcelain throne the royal treatment. Japanese electronic bidet seat maker Toto sells a “washlet” for as much as $1,420 on bidetking.com, equipped with a water heating system (that heats the toilet seat and the jet streams of water that clean the user’s backside), a wireless remote control (with multiple spray settings) and a hands-free dryer. Tushy, defined by its whimsical marketing, sells a popular bidet attachment starting at $99.Few people buy a bidet every year, so much of the growth is coming from new customers. Often, bidet sales spread just through word of mouth. Once one person is converted to the new method of bathroom sanitation, they want their friends and family to join the club. And many of those customers often become entrenched rather than transient.Some customers who start with more basic washer attachments are now upgrading to electronic models that have different temperature and pressure settings. The most popular type of bidet in the US, Lin said, is a non-electric attachment that only sprays cold water, found for less than $50 on sites like Amazon.Others have found an even cheaper alternative. Joe from Michigan, who did not want to be identified by his last name, says he grabbed a bidet attached to a toilet being discarded on the side of the street, and purchased an adapter hose to fit it into his home (after sanitizing it).“Gosh, I wish I would have known about it sooner,” Joe told CNN.The idea to use flowing water – rather than harder objects, whether leaves or paper – to clean one’s underside may be as old as human existence.The bidet originated in France, used by aristocrats as a separate piece of furniture next to the chamber pot. Variations of the bidet are ubiquitous in a large swath of Europe to the Middle East, East Asia and some South American countries.During the booming electronics era, the Japanese brand Toto revolutionized the washlet in 1980 with a toilet seat attachment that uses warm water to cleanse. The devices have proliferated to homes and businesses around Japan and beyond.A common reason why bidets aren’t used in the US is that during World War 2, American soldiers saw brothels utilizing bidets. When they came back to United States, they shunned the bidet because of the connotations. Plus, the construction boom that took place in the post-war years built plumbing systems without bidets. (Japanese washlets and other devices, however, connect to existing toilets and don’t require separate plumbing like French-style bidets.)The foreignness of bidets stuck. Some of the new bidet users CNN interviewed said they had associated the object with places like Europe or Japan, or something found in fancy hotels. When Joe and his wife lived in Spain, he initially didn’t even know what the unattached bidet in their apartment bathroom was used for.Agrawal, the Tushy founder, said she was drawn to the bidet business because it was a standard practice she grew up in with an Indian father and Japanese mother.Of course, for many, water-based cleanliness has long been entrenched in their culture, going back centuries.For example, for practicing Muslims, the Islamic jurisprudence lays out strict guidelines on washing oneself. Many Asian and Middle Eastern countries utilize “bum guns,” or low-cost handheld sprayers attached by a hose to the side of the toilet, or jugs that look like watering cans.Eyad Atieh, a resident physician in Illinois, spent part of his childhood and adolesence in Jordan, where every house had a bidet installed. In his medical training, he learned the bidet’s health benefits, especially for those who suffer from hemorrhoids and hernias.“A big part of our culture is using water to clean, otherwise you can’t pray, you can’t be considered clean Islamically,” Atieh said.When the great toilet paper shortage hit in 2020, many Americans realized there could be another way to clean themselves. Environmental concerns around trees, paper and waste perhaps also played a role.Using toilet paper had seemed, somehow, American, with toilet paper jokes a staple in bathroom humor and “TP-ing” a stereotypical rite of passage for teens. And little is more American than the Charmin bear, an industry emblem that already dominates aisles of supermarkets.So, “getting consumers to do something different, they have to undo all those brand associations (with toilet paper) and all those habits they have,” Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Kellogg School of Management told CNN.Rucker said the bidet industry would need to become a social norm in the US, such as being built into more new home constructions. Many bidet users in the US were converted after visiting societies where bidet use is widespread.Mikaela Koelzer, in Chicago, visited Japan the summer before the pandemic and was awestruck by the variety of bidet settings in even the most hole-in-the-wall restaurants.Then the pandemic hit, and Koelzer had “nothing but time” to find “pockets of joy” in her day. With the toilet paper mania, she decided to kill two birds with one stone and splurge on a Tushy.“It moreso was just about nurturing myself and feeling like I was doing something good for myself in a way that I could control, because everything else was just so out of control,” Koelzer said.Though Koelzer has a basic Tushy, her parents are now looking into a more state-of-the-art one that has temperature controls, she says. Two of her friends are now “proud bidet owners.”', 'It’s been a bumpy road for the stock market this year, but investors aren’t complaining.That’s because markets have rallied to new highs and have already soared past analysts’ 2024 estimates.The S&P 500 has surged more than 10% since January, and last week it surpassed Goldman Sachs’ year-end target of 5,200.So what comes next?The question is weighing heavily on the minds of investors, Goldman Sachs’ strategists wrote in a note Friday.The analysts, led by Goldman’s chief US equity strategist, David Kostin, presented a scenario in which mega-cap tech stocks could continue to grow and propel the S&P 500 an additional 15% higher to the 6,000 level by the end of the year.The current rally in growth stocks is different from what happened when markets crashed in 2021 or during the tech bubble, the analysts wrote. This time around, investors are paying closer attention to how much profit companies are actually bringing in, they said.And while enthusiasm for artificial intelligence is at a fever pitch, Goldman’s analysts said growth expectations and valuations for the largest technology, media and telecommunication stocks are “still far from bubble territory.”The investment bank also presented a more tempered scenario in which the S&P 500 climbs 11% to reach 5,800 by year-end. In this case, markets would just have to catch up to their pre-pandemic valuation levels.Either of these shifts higher, analysts wrote, are dependent on the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. Investors have been worried that the central bank will keep interest rates elevated for longer than previously expected in response to persistently high interest rates.“A shift in the interest rate outlook without a deterioration in the economy is necessary for the market rally to broaden,” the analysts said. “Today, a large swath of the market remains weighed down by concerns of ‘high-for-longer’ interest.”They also presented a worst-case scenario in which mega tech stocks could fail to live up to expectations, causing markets to fall by 14% this year.But for now, Goldman analysts will keep their baseline prediction of 5,200 for the S&P 500 unchanged. That means markets would drop by about 1% before the end of the year.“Both our expected path of the federal funds rate and our above-consensus economic growth forecast appear to already be priced by markets,” they wrote.', 'The reports of harrowing and sometimes tragic incidents aboard airplanes accelerated this year, leading many to wonder if it’s still safe to fly.A door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight leaving a gaping hole in the Boeing 737 Max fuselage. Passengers’ phones and clothing were ripped from their bodies and sent hurtling out into the night as oxygen masks dropped and the plane made its way to the ground, fortunately without any serious injuries.Another Boeing jet plunged so severely that passengers were thrown onto the ceiling of the cabin, leaving dozens so injured they need to be hospitalized upon landing.A passenger plane collided with a military plane at a Tokyo airport, killing five members of the Japanese Coast Guard who were responding to an earthquake.And more minor incidents happened, like when a 200-pound wheel fell off a plane on takeoff, crushing parked vehicles on the ground. Another plane’s engine caught fire. A jet arrived at an airport only to have a missing panel discovered. These incidents all gained attention worthy of a Kardashian on social media.But answering the question of whether it is still safe to fly is not so straightforward.The quick answer is that flying is safe — safer than most forms of travel — and far, far safer than the car ride most people take every day without thinking twice.“When you arrive at the airport, and step aboard the pressurized tube, that’s the safest part of the trip,” said Anthony Brickhouse, a crash investigator and professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “You were more at risk driving to the airport.”But it’s also true that it’s only pure luck that the American aviation industry has kept its near-perfect safety record intact.Since a regional jet crashed in Buffalo, New York, in January of 2009, killing 49 on board and one on the ground, only five other people have died in accidents on scheduled commercial flights in the United States:By comparison, an average of more than 100 people a day died on America’s roads and highways between 2003 and 2022, the most recent year for which full year traffic deaths are available. That means nearly as many died on roads and highways every hour, on average, as the number of people who died in US commercial aviation crashes in 15 years.However, other forms of flying are not nearly as safe.Nearly 300 people have died since 2009 while traveling in “on demand” air service, such as private jets. And nearly 5,500 people have died in general aviation, which are typically small planes often operated by amateur pilots.While commercial aviation has the safest record among transit options, railroads are the second safest form of travel.Railroads had 71 passenger deaths on commuter trains and Amtrak from 2009 through last year. But passenger trains logged far fewer miles traveled than planes or motor vehicles.When you control for the much higher number of miles traveled by planes, it’s clearly much more dangerous to travel on the ground than to fly on a commercial US airline.Ed Pierson, the director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a harsh critic of Boeing, said he knows the stats, but because of concerns about quality controls at the embattled aircraft maker, he still would refuse to fly on the Boeing 737 Max or have a family member do so. He has even gotten off a Max just before departure after he was surprised to find out he was on that particular model of plane.Still, Pierson said he is willing to fly on most planes, even many older Boeing models.“Taking the Max out of the equation, (flying has) been proven to be pretty darn safe,” he said.Unfortunately, the safety record of recent years is not a guarantee of safety in the future.The record for the nearly fatality-free US airplane travel industry is partly due to the efforts of aviation authorities, airlines and aircraft manufacturers, despite the criticism heaped on all three of those groups recently.But mainly it’s been sheer luck. In each case, if things had gone just a little differently, the outcomes could have been much worse.The Alaska Air plane that lost the door plug had flown for more than two months without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.It had made 153 flights before the door plug blew out at 16,000 feet. Twenty-two of those flights were between Hawaii and the mainland.If the door had blown out at the normal 35,000-foot cruising altitude, or hours from the nearest airport over the open Pacific Ocean, or if the plug had gone straight back and hit the tail of the plane and caused damage, it could likely have caused a loss of the aircraft and the 177 people on board.And that’s not the biggest break. A year ago, the discussion about air safety wasn’t focused on Boeing planes. It was on a series of near-misses on runways at the nation’s airports with reports of incident after incident of narrowly averted collisions.On February 4, 2023, a FedEx jet came within 150 feet of the runway before its pilots realized a Southwest jet was in the process of taking off on the same runway. It was one of five such incidents in which an accident was only narrowly avoided in a period of just seven weeks at the start of last year.And none of those were as potentially serious as another incident in July 2017, when an Air Canada jet piloted by a captain who had been awake for more than 19 hours nearly landed on a taxiway at San Francisco International Airport where three wide-body jets filled with passengers were waiting to take off.The NTSB later determined the Air Canada jet got within 100 feet of the ground before it took off again without making contact with any of the passenger planes on the ground. The safety regulator said more than 1,000 people on the four planes might have died had the accident not been averted at the last moment.“It would have been the worst disaster in aviation history,” Brickhouse said. “Pilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics — they’re all human, and humans make mistakes. We’ve been working toward designing the system so that when mistakes are made, we can recover from them without it being a tragedy.”But Pierson said the system is under unprecedented stress, and regulators, airlines and aircraft manufactures like Boeing need to make changes.“I think the system is under tremendous stress,” he said. “There’s a shortage of staff, in air traffic control, a shortage of pilots, of maintenance personnel, of manufacturing personnel.”What concerns Pierson the most is the attitude that the apparent safety of the American aviation system means nothing needs to be improved.“There’s a sense of overconfidence,” he said. “The gold standard is melting down, because we continue to try to downplay everything and talk about how safe the system is. That’s not the right mindset. That’s the mindset that gets people killed.”Brickhouse believes the planes now in use are safe. He said the drama of the Alaska Air incident brought attention to a series of other events that in and of themselves don’t pose a serious threat, even if they should not have happened.“We have safety events in aviation all the time. That is not an indictment of the aviation industry,” he said. “But after Alaska Air, it became a snowballing event and everyone became hypersensitive.”Despite having more confidence in the safety of the system than Pierson, Brickhouse said he also wouldn’t dismiss anyone who’s fearful about flying right now or who wants to avoid a plane like the 737 Max. And he has his own concerns about things like the number of narrowly avoided accidents at the nation’s airports.“I don’t believe in luck, but we are fortunate that these incidents  did not turn into disasters,” he said. “When you have a trend that keeps occurring, you need to focus on fixing it.”', 'Carlos Sainz claimed an impressive victory at the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday, breaking Max Verstappen’s dominant grip over this F1 season as the Red Bull driver was forced to retire from the race.Remarkably, it marked Sainz’s first race back since undergoing appendix surgery just two weeks ago, after appendicitis had caused him to withdraw from the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix where he was replaced by 18-year-old reserve driver Oliver Bearman.The Spaniard began the race second on the grid, behind pole-sitter Verstappen, and stuck close to the three-time world champion before easily overtaking him on the second lap to take the lead.And shortly afterwards, the scale of Verstappen’s problems with his car became apparent as he shouted over the radio, “I have smoke, fire, fire, brake, my brake,” before slowing down and limping into the pit lane with smoke streaming behind him and fire in his wheels.For just the first time in two years, he retired from a Grand Prix, citing brake failure. Afterwards, the 26-year-old expressed his disappointment.“Yeah, it’s not ideal. Of course you always want to finish the races but it’s a mechanical sport,” Verstappen said following his first retirement since the 2022 Australian Grand Prix.“These things unfortunately happen, but I think it’s the most important that we understand why it happened.”The Dutchman’s departure from the race left the remainer wide open such has been his dominance over the last two seasons.Sainz’s lead was never truly threatened, though, and he held onto secure victory with his teammate Charles Leclerc finishing second to complete a Ferrari 1-2.“I felt really good out there,” Sainz told Sky Sports after the race. “Of course, a bit stiff and especially physically it wasn’t the easiest but I was lucky I was more or less on my own and I could manage my pace, my tyres, manage everything, and it wasn’t the toughest race of all.“But very happy, very proud of the team, and happy to be in a 1-2 with Charles here. It shows that hard work pays off and life sometimes is crazy.”Lando Norris finished third and his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri finished fourth as they held off the challenge of Sergio Pérez who could only muster fifth place despite his all-conquering Red Bull car.Mercedes, meanwhile, suffered a nightmare race as both cars retired from the race. Lewis Hamilton suffered an engine failure on lap 17 while George Russell hit the wall on the last lap of the race as he chased sixth place, prompting a virtual safety car to end the race.', 'For every other figure-skater, landing a quadruple axel lies outside the realms of possibilities, attempted but never accomplished by an endless parade of skating greats.For American teenage prodigy Ilia Malinin though, they are simply part of his routine. And landing one on Saturday propelled him to his first ever world title after a record-breaking performance in the free skate at the World Figure Skating Championship.The 19-year-old – who is nicknamed the ‘quad god’ – was sitting in third place after the short program on Thursday, telling reporters afterwards that he was suffering with physical and mental challenges in the build-up to these world championships.Then, on Saturday, he was drawn last to compete in the free skate and produced a dazzling performance to score 227.79, the highest ever score in this competition, before collapsing onto the ice with emotion.“It means so much to me,” Malinin said afterwards, according to the International Skating Union. “The last few weeks were such a mental and physical challenge to go through.“I was even debating whether I should come here or not. It was the last minute, but I wanted to come here to see what I can put out on the ice. I am so glad to be here on top right now.”Skating to music from the TV series “Succession,” Malinin opened his free skate with a quadruple axel, before landing five more quad jumps in front of crowd stunned in disbelief.He is still the only man to land the quadruple axel.He won by a staggering 24 points, ahead of Japan’s Kagiyama Yuma in second place and France’s Adam Siao Him Fa in third, who rose from 19th place after the short program.“There was a little voice in my head: ‘No matter what, you have to keep fighting, keep going, no matter how bad you feel you just have to know that you’re capable of,’” Malinin added, per the Olympics.His gold medal was the US’s second at this World Championships after Madison Chock and Evan Bates won the ice dance earlier on Saturday.', 'There are certain bad design decisions that seem to persist for no good reason. Like when you buy a pair of scissors but can’t get to them because they’re trapped inside a hard plastic shell that requires scissors to open. Or the Apple mouse, with its port on the underside, rendering it unusable while charging.These frustrations don’t make a product bad, per se; they’re just irksome. The kind of little frictions that make you think, Why’d they do that?No standard spoon can fit inside the narrow openings of the typical glass caper jar. Dumping them out risks loss of essential brine. Even if you do have a supremely tiny utensil to fish them out, there’s no single-dip solution: At best you can capture three or four in one go, and any piccata recipe or lox spread worth its salt calls for, like, at least a dozen capers. Why, dear God, why do they do that?This is a story about one of modern life’s least consequential but most acutely annoying experiences: getting a sufficient number of capers out of those dollhouse-size jars they’re sold in.The short, unsatisfying answer? Capers are expensive, so producers sell them in smaller jars to make each unit more affordable. But the reason for tall jars instead of squat ones is a longer story.For the uninitiated, capers are the unripened, pea-sized buds of the prickly caper bush, or Capparis spinosa. Let them ripen, and you get caper berries, which are sort of like olives. The caper bush is a hardy shrub, happiest when rooted on a rocky cliff under a hot Mediterranean sun.Straight off the vine, capers are terribly bitter. But someone, somewhere (likely hundreds of years ago), got it in their heads to\\xa0take those practically inedible buds, dry\\xa0them\\xa0out in a boatload of sea salt and then\\xa0rehydrate them.Once they’re cured and pickled, capers become perfect little salt bombs to drop into a niçoise salad or a chicken piccata. It’s not illegal to order a lox bagel in New York City without capers, but it should be.A definitive explanation for the svelte glass jar that they come in is hard to come by. Major caper purveyors Cento and Goya did not respond to requests for comment.Reddit threads on the subject tend to upvote the theory that the tall, skinny glass jars keep the capers fresh by ensuring they stay submerged in their brine.Russell Zwanka, the director of the food marketing program at Western Michigan University, echoed that as a plausible theory.“I do understand the frustration of a spoon not fitting, and I don’t have an answer for that,” Zwanka said. “I don’t know why you can’t make it just another half an inch bigger.”There is another, more profit-focused theory. It’s courtesy of Jeff Mezzetta, the president of the privately owned California food label Mezzetta (which sells its capers in a variety of jar sizes, all with enough clearance for a regular teaspoon).Skinny jars just look nicer, Mezzetta says.After all, there’s little practical value to the skinny jar. In fact, it’s far less practical, from the producers’ standpoint.“The taller and the thinner the jar, the more difficult it is to package — because they’re tippy on the production lines, and with the smaller opening, they’re harder to get into the jar,” said Mezzetta, a connoisseur so passionate about the garnish that he even named his dog, a black Labrador, Caper.His take: “It’s primarily because some marketer feels that they’re going to look more elegant on the shelf.”There are sound economics behind that theory.Food packaging does a lot of different things, Zwanka says. It of course keeps food fresh, prevents waste and makes sure the product can be shipped efficiently.“But we also want to make sure that products are affordable,” he said.Because capers are expensive\\xa0— and not exactly a staple of the American refrigerator, although sales are rising, according to Mezzetta — food companies opt for smaller jars to keep down the per-unit cost for consumers.Zwanka notes a similar packaging dilemma with saffron, one of the world’s most expensive spices. When you buy it at the grocery store, it’s perhaps disheartening to see a few tiny strings packed into the jar for $18.“You need the jar so it’ll fit in the in the spice rack,” he says. “But you also couldn’t fill that jar, or it would be $200.”If you’re only using a few capers a year, a tiny jar that can live unobtrusively in the fridge makes sense for most people. Prices vary, but a 3-ounce jar runs you about $4 at the grocery store.Still, you might wonder: Why is it a that jar so tall and narrow you need a nail file to stab at the tiny green orbs?Blame the success of Skinny Can Chic.Strolling down the soda aisle lately, you’ll notice that beverage cans have slimmed down, squeezing the same 12 ounces of fluid into a more slender package.“Consumers see slim cans as more sophisticated, which makes them feel more sophisticated,” Duane Stanford, the editor of industry trade publication Beverage Digest, told CNN last year.The same thing is happening in the beer aisle, Zwanka notes.“They’ve all adapted what you would consider the Red Bull can, because Red Bull kind of started it. But now anybody who wants to signify that it is thinner, lighter, less calories, maybe healthier … they put it thinner cans.”Labor costs are the main reason capers cost more than you might expect from what is essentially a pickled weed. The vast majority of the capers at the grocery store are grown in the wild in places like Morocco, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey, and they are picked by hand.“It takes you an hour to pick a kilo, if you’re very fast,” says Brian Noone, who runs a wholesale caper plant nursery in Adelaide, South Australia. “The other problem is, people tend to think the smaller ones taste better…But it’s a lot more work to get the smaller ones,” which are called “non-pareils.”Once they get to your kitchen, there are a number of hacks for getting them out of the jar.A Reddit page on the universally frustrating process is titled: “getting capers out of those stupid f*cking narrow jars.”Among the tips and tricks offered by Redditors:Try a a long metal bar spoon or a half-teaspoon measuring spoon. Other common utensil suggestions: An old fashioned potato peeler, chef’s tweezers, a tiny melon baller, a wide-mouth boba straw.“I use a tiny fork. Like the kind for shrimp cocktail or crab,” offers one user.“Korean dessert fork for me! It’s a tiny fork head on a long chopstick-shaped handle,” says another.But perhaps there’s no solution quite as simple as going all in — and dumping them all out.As one Redditor said: “I’ve never been in a situation where I don’t decide to just use the entire tiny jar for what I’m making.”', 'Kevin Bacon is ready to cut loose at prom.Bacon announced this week to a gym full of students from Utah’s Payson High School, where his iconic movie “Footloose” was filmed, that he will be making an appearance at the school’s final prom.This comes after students launched a campaign to get the actor to attend the event. Payson High School is set to relocate at the end of the school year.The #BacontoPayson social media campaign was a collective effort that got students involved in movie recreations and choreographed videos in hopes of getting Bacon’s attention.In an announcement broadcast on the “Today” show, Bacon thanked the students for their invitation, calling the film and high school “a big part of my life.”When he announced he’d be coming, the students, who were gathered together at the school for the announcement, cheered.“Thank you, guys. Let’s dance,” Bacon said.“Footloose” was released in 1984 and starred Bacon as a teenager who moves to a small town that forbids dancing and works to overturn the draconian measure. It all culminates in a prom scene that, surely in part thanks to Kenny Loggins, apparently still resonates.', 'A glowing worm moon will light up the sky on Monday with a celestial performance in store for people venturing out in the early morning hours — a penumbral lunar eclipse.March’s full moon, referred to as the worm moon by the\\xa0Farmers’ Almanac\\xa0due to its proximity to the spring equinox, will be at its fullest at 3 a.m. ET.A few hours earlier, starting at 12:53 a.m. ET,\\xa0according to EarthSky, the moon will be almost perfectly aligned with the sun and Earth, causing the outer edge of Earth’s shadow, known as the penumbra, to be cast onto the glowing orb.The greatest eclipse will be at\\xa03:12 a.m. ET, when the moon will appear to be slightly darker than usual, said\\xa0Dr. Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.“It’ll be almost a gradient of darkening happening from one side of the moon to the other. It’s not going to be a super dramatic change in what we see in the moon,” Schmoll said. “But if you’re sitting there watching it, you might notice some slight variations in brightness.”The worm moon — named by Native American tribes in reference to the beetle larvae and other creatures that emerge from hibernation in the spring — will be visible to everyone across the world, since the moon will appear to be full\\xa0for a couple of days.However, the penumbral eclipse will only be visible to those who are on the\\xa0night side of Earth\\xa0when the event occurs, including Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America. The lunar eclipse will finish at 5:33 a.m. ET, according to EarthSky.The penumbral eclipse comes about two weeks before a total solar eclipse that will cross Mexico, the United States and Canada on April 8. Lunar and solar eclipses always come in pairs due to the period when the sun, Earth and moon stay aligned, Schmoll said. While the full moon will be caught in Earth’s shadow during this penumbral eclipse, the moon’s next new moon phase will allow for the conditions needed for a solar eclipse, when the moon will be in between the sun and Earth and thus block the face of the sun from view.An “eclipse season” is the approximate 35-day period that occurs every six months, near the equinoxes,\\xa0when the near-perfect alignment of the three celestial bodies needed for eclipses occurs,\\xa0according to NASA.A lunar eclipse does not happen monthly during each full moon because the moon’s orbital plane is tilted by about 5 degrees, so for most full moons, the shadow of the Earth will be just below or above the moon, Schmoll said.While a penumbral eclipse is not as dramatic as a total lunar eclipse with the moon appearing an eerie red, there is no special equipment required to view a lunar eclipse such as the viewing glasses needed for a solar eclipse, Schmoll said, allowing for lunar eclipses to be viewed with the naked eye.“You pretty much just need to be outside with a clear view of the moon when it’s happening,” Schmoll added. “(Eclipses are) always a good excuse to go outside and try to look at the sky and appreciate where we are in the universe, and what we are able to observe from our planet.”While the most highly anticipated of the four eclipse events occurring in 2024 is the\\xa0total solar eclipse on April 8, an annular solar eclipse will occur on October 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can’t completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a “ring of fire” in the sky as the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow.Meanwhile, a partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between September 17 and 18.Check\\xa0Time and Date’s website\\xa0to see when each of these eclipses will appear.Of the 12 full moons in 2024, the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to\\xa0EarthSky.Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit.Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:• April 23: Pink moon• May 23: Flower moon• June 21: Strawberry moon• July 21: Buck moon• August 19: Sturgeon moon• September 17: Harvest moon• October 17: Hunter’s moon• November 15: Beaver moon• December 15: Cold moonSkygazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the\\xa0American Meteor Society.

With her partner Maxime Deschamps, the 40-year-old former retiree defeated athletes less than half her age and became the oldest woman to win a World Figure Skating Championship.Even more remarkable, she did it in the pairs event – a notoriously dangerous discipline in which the top women are thrown across the ice, lifted over their partners’ heads with one arm, and tossed more than 10 feet in the air – all while spinning around multiple times.Stellato-Dudek said she hopes the historic victory inspires everyone, even non-skaters, who might think it’s too late to pursue and achieve their goals.“I hope it encourages people to not stop before they reach their potential,” she told reporters after winning the title Thursday night. “And I hope it transcends into other areas, not just in sports, but also in other areas of life, like work and professional careers.”In a sport full of dangerous skills and merciless injuries, figure skaters often retire by their mid-20s.That’s exactly what Stellato-Dudek did. She had an impressive junior career as a singles skater, winning the 1999-2000 international Junior Grand Prix Final and capturing the silver medal at the 2000 World Junior Championships.But she suffered a spate of injuries, including a broken left ankle, a torn ligament in her right ankle and a significant hip injury. So she retired in 2001, at age 17.For the next 16 years, Stellato-Dudek lived a relatively normal adulthood. She became a successful aesthetician and got married. She was no longer attempting risky triple jumps on international ice.But the pangs of unfinished business kept nagging at her. What if she had quit the sport too early? What if she had more to accomplish in skating?So she tried on her old skates and attempted the unfathomable – learning how to become a pairs skater in her 30s and returning to competitive ice.While elite singles skating often rewards youth – requiring immense stamina to pull off quadruple jumps or triple-triple jump combinations – pairs skating comes with its own hazards. Female pairs skaters must have the strength to stabilize themselves high in the air and enough control to land powerful throw triple jumps on a narrow blade of steel. Failure to do either can end in disaster.Then there’s the challenge of finding a partner. In 2016, Stellato-Dudek, who’s from the Chicago area, moved to Florida to start skating with Nathan Bartholomay, a 2014 Olympian who was looking for a new partner. They won two national bronze medals as a pair before Bartholomay’s injuries ended their partnership in 2019.Undeterred, Stellato-Dudek “called every single coach I’d ever met in my entire life to see if they had anyone available” as a potential partner, she told writer Beverley Smith.The search led her to Canada and Deschamps, a Quebec native who was more than eight years younger. He also had a successful junior career and has been open about his own personal challenges, including living with ADHD.Stellato-Dudek uprooted her life in Chicago and moved to Montreal to skate with her new partner. The gamble paid off, and now Stellato-Dudek and Deschamps are unlikely world champions at ages 40 and 32.Being the oldest female world champion was “not something that I ever set out to do when I came back to skating,” Stellato-Dudek said after her victory. “But I knew that if I were to accomplish my dreams it would inevitably occur because I’m the oldest everywhere.”And being the oldest is perfectly fine with her.“It’s something I carry with pride, and I’m very proud of it,” she said. “I hope a lot of athletes stay around a lot longer.”One of the pair’s top rivals for the world title, German skater Minerva Fabienne Hase, bowed down to the couple after their winning performance. At 24, Hase was a baby when Stellato-Dudek retired.“Deanna, with your age, it’s amazing. We were all bowing in front of you,” Hase said, according to CNN partner CBC. “You have my highest respect.”Stellato-Dudek is not done. Her next major goal is to compete in the 2026 Winter Olympics at age 42 – potentially shattering records once again.But first, she needs to become a Canadian citizen. When she and Deschamps first teamed up a few years ago, they decided to represent Canada instead of the US because they thought it would be faster for her to get Canadian citizenship than for him to attain US citizenship.“I’m doing all that I can do to make myself more attractive to Canada,” Stellato-Dudek said with a laugh after winning the short program this week, according to NBC Sports.The citizenship requirement made the 2022 Olympics virtually impossible for the pair.So “my goal has always been 2026, if my body can last that long,” Stellato-Dudek told Smith in 2020. “I’m already too old to be doing this, so I can be too old in six years, too. So what’s the difference?”It won’t be easy. Stellato-Dudek already endures two to three hours of extra physical training every night to prepare her 40-year-old body for the next day’s practice, according to NBC Sports.But her palpable intensity and voracious approach to training every day leaves little doubt she can be ready for the next Olympics.“She is a warrior,” her partner said. “For her, it’s the Olympics every day.”', 'Austria’s Christoph Baumgartner scored the fastest ever international goal on Saturday, taking just six seconds to find the back of the net during his country’s 2-0 victory against Slovakia.Immediately after kickoff, he weaved through the Slovakian defense before rifling the ball into the net from well outside the box, sparking wild celebrations on and off the pitch as he was mobbed by his teammates and the traveling Austrian fans jumped up and down in the stands.The 24-year-old’s goal was even faster than Lukas Podolski’s strike for Germany against Ecuador in 2013, which clocked in at seven seconds and was the previous record.Austria had to wait more than 80 minutes for its second goal when Andreas Weinmann doubled its lead and secured a 2-0 victory.It wasn’t the only extremly early goal of the day.Later that evening, Florian Wirtz scored Germany’s fastest ever international goal as his team claimed a 2-0 victory against France in Lyon, taking just a second longer than Baumgartner to find the back of the net.His effort was a few hundredths of second faster than Poldoski in 2013 and came from a pre-planned move after he latched onto Toni Kroos’ long pass downfield from halfway, continued unmarked and fired in a strike from outside the box.“We had a very good start and the kickoff was planned exactly that way,” Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann said afterwards, per Reuters.“It was important to protect the lead and after the break we improved further and carved out more chances. I am very satisfied with the way we fought. It is what we wish, to give it all every time.France never recovered from such an early blow, and when Kai Havertz scored Germany’s second goal shortly after halftime, Germany never reliquished its two-goal lead over the 2022 World Cup runners up.', 'The Prince and Princess of Wales expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support they have received from the public after Catherine, Princess of Wales, announced she has cancer.“The Prince and Princess are both enormously touched by the kind messages from people here in the UK, across the Commonwealth and around the world in response to Her Royal Highness’ message. They are extremely moved by the public’s warmth and support and are grateful for the understanding of their request for privacy at this time,” a\\xa0Kensington Palace spokesperson said Saturday.The princess, known as Kate, described her diagnosis as a “huge shock” in a video\\xa0statement\\xa0released on social media.The news comes two months after she stepped away from public life following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. Kate has since faced wild speculation over her health.“In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous,” said Catherine, 42, who is married to the heir to the British throne, Prince William.“The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.”The princess started preventative chemotherapy in late February, a royal source told CNN, adding that Kate had been expected to return to official duties after Easter, however she will now postpone further work until she has been cleared to do so by her medical team.Kensington Palace is not expected to reveal any further medical details such as the type of cancer or what stage it is.', 'Technology has revolutionized how people book travel, buy groceries and manage their everyday finances. Yet, the process of buying a home has withstood many similar changes.Sites like Redfin and Zillow provide a way for buyers and brokers to connect online, but the role of real estate agents in closing purchases has persisted.Now the seismic\\xa0settlement\\xa0between the National Association of Realtors and home sellers could change\\xa0that, as home buyers and sellers face the prospect of paying their agents separately, instead of sellers paying a commission split between both sides. That, in turn, opens the door for new technology to reshape the agents’ role, as people in other jobs — from the world of finance to travel — have already experienced.Given the settlement, Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said buyers’ agents might see their work simplified through technology consumers can use themselves, similar to changes in money management.“I think we are reaching a point where there’s going to be a lot of innovation in the housing market,” Piskorski said. “One simple idea is: Do homeowners really need a real estate agent?”Nearly half of home buyers began their search online, according to a 2023 report by the NAR, and many buyers do home research themselves.“Ultimately, people will understand what real estate agents really do, especially on the buy side,” Piskorski said. “The whole business model actually under which we operate right now makes these fees not very transparent to home buyers.”Danielle Hale, chief economist at\\xa0Realtor.com, told CNN in an email that technology could make things easier for buyers in an industry that has often been opaque.“Ultimately, if these changes bring about greater consumer transparency, that’s a good thing,” Hale told CNN.But even with the possibility of major changes, Hale said, one thing will almost certainly remain the same for real estate agents. Buyers, she noted, “will likely be reluctant to navigate the financial decision of a lifetime without their professional expertise and support.”The NAR settlement essentially decouples the buyers’ and sellers’ agents. While  previously home sellers have paid a commission (generally 5% to 6%) that was split between agents, the settlement makes it so home buyers might be on the hook for paying their agent up front.Experts told CNN that could affect how home buyers think about enlisting an agent.Currently, the framework of real estate solely emphasizes the buy and sell transaction, said John Bodrozic, co-founder of HomeZada, a real estate tech company. Yet, as technology simplifies the process, agents will have to advertise their value as long-term consultants in a niche industry.Bodrozic said tech will enable real estate to become more like personal finance in this sense.“I really believe it’s a bigger picture here, which is the opportunity for the real estate industry to think of their clients as a never-ending client that I want to keep happy and provide value to throughout their entire journey,” he said.Bobby Juncosa, chief technology officer of Edgewise, a real estate tech company, said there are lessons from how travel agents changed as technology has allowed people to search for, compare and purchase\\xa0flights on their own.“The buyers’ agent will become, this is the part that’s a little bit more controversial, but a little bit more travel agent-esque, and they’re kind of pointing you in the right direction,” he said. “You know, ‘this neighborhood has good schools,’ all things that are public information that you could find out on your own, but you’re hoping for that local expertise.”A lot of real estate transactions could be digitized, and this settlement may provide impetus for that, Piskorski said. He said developments in tech that organize home inspections, make arrangements to hire lawyers or fulfill  other duties of a buyers’ agent, would “significantly reduce the costs associated with home transactions.”Even as technology expands further into the real estate industry, Piskorski said\\xa0he thinks a fully automated process, such as an Amazon marketplace for buying and selling homes, is still far in the distance.The real estate market, he said, is “too complex to be completely automated on a computer.”Juncosa said as the industry adjusts to the settlement rules, agents will become more like consultants throughout the home buying process, offering value-add insight. Yet what ultimately differentiates a travel agent from a real estate agent is the value and risk associated with the purchase.Purchasing a home is a major life decision, and some people will always benefit from the assurance of a broker, Juncosa said.A key point of home buying is the behavioral aspect, Piskorski said. “Some households just want a human being to be with them, to assure them that this is the right decision,” he said.Ultimately, Juncosa said that agents serve a fundamentally human purpose: reassuring homebuyers about the biggest financial decisions of their lives.', 'Investors have approved a deal on Friday to make Truth Social owner Trump Media a publicly traded company.The green light from shareholders clears a major hurdle for a long-delayed merger that will generate a multi-billion dollar windfall for former President Donald Trump at a time when he’s facing immense financial and legal pressure.According to a preliminary vote total announced during the meeting, a majority of shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp. voted in favor of the deal to merge with Trump Media. The companies have indicated the merger could close as soon as early next week.The new company will be called Trump Media & Technology Group and trade under the ticker DJT, Trump’s initials. It will own Trump’s struggling social media platform Truth Social.Shareholders voted to approve Trump Media’s merger with a blank-check company, following years of legal and regulatory obstacles. Trump will own a dominant stake in a public company, with shares worth more than $3 billion at current market prices.However, experts tell CNN there are numerous practical, financial and legal reasons why this deal is unlikely to solve Trump’s imminent cash crunch.“President Trump won’t be able to monetize that stake right away,” said Matthew Kennedy, senior initial public offering market strategist at Renaissance Capital.Trump faces a Monday deadline to post a $464 million bond in New York’s civil fraud case against him or New York’s attorney general could try to seize his golf course and private estate north of Manhattan – or other assets.The good news for Trump is that there are strong incentives for shareholders to approve the merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp.If it gets the green light from shareholders, Trump stands to be the dominant shareholder, with a stake of at least 58.1%, according to filings.The merger agreement calls for Trump to own roughly 79 million shares of the new public company – and potentially tens of millions more if certain goals are hit.At Digital World’s share price of around $43 Thursday, that massive stake would be worth $3.4 billion – at least on paper. But Digital World shares were volatile Friday, and they were closed 14% lower.The merger could close swiftly.Regulatory filings indicate the companies expect to close the merger on the second business day after the shareholder vote is approved. That sets the stage for trading to begin under the new name and ticker symbol by Tuesday or Wednesday, although it could take longer, according to Kennedy.But the deal still faces legal uncertainty. There is ongoing litigation seeking to block the merger from closing.The bad news for Trump is that this stake is not as liquid as it sounds. Those paper gains would be very difficult for Trump to translate to actual cash.In fact, Trump’s shares in this company are in many ways even less liquid than his real estate holdings, according to Charles Whitehead, a law professor at Cornell Law School.First, experts say the market is drastically overvaluing Trump Media based on the company’s fundamentals.That means Trump would have a hard time dumping the stock or even pledging it as collateral.“The stock price is clearly a bubble,” Yale law professor Jonathan Macey told CNN. “No rational investor would take the stock at face value, especially if they had to hold it for any length of time.”SEC filings indicate Trump Media’s revenue amounted to just $1.1 million during the third quarter. The company posted a loss of $26 million that quarter.Not only that, but Truth Social appears to be shrinking.The number of Truth Social’s US monthly active users on iOS and Android is down 39% year-over-year, according to Similarweb data shared with CNN earlier this month. Truth Social remains much smaller than X (formerly Twitter), which is also shrinking but at a slower pace.And yet Trump Media is being valued north of $6 billion on a fully diluted basis, which includes all stocks and options that could be converted to common stock, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.Ritter said the current market price is hard, if not impossible, to justify.“It is grossly overvalued,” said Ritter. “It qualifies as a meme stock for which the price is divorced from fundamental value…Meme stock investors are usually buying on the basis of the greater fool theory of investing: It is overvalued today, but I hope to make money selling it to an even greater fool tomorrow at an even higher price.”But even in the unlikely event that Trump found a taker for those shares, experts say he is likely not allowed to sell or pledge that stock – at least not yet.As is typical in a deal like this, certain shareholders are subject to a lock-up period that prevents insiders from immediately selling.“No one wants to buy into a company where the largest shareholder – and really the face of the biggest product – is selling,” said Whitehead.In this case, key shareholders of Trump Media, including its management team, have agreed not to sell their common stock for six months to maintain “important stability to the leadership and governance” of the company, according to SEC filings.Not only does that lock-up agreement prevent these key shareholders from selling their stock for six months, it says they have agreed not to “lend, offer, pledge…encumber, donate” that stock during the period.If the share price stays above $12 for a period of time, it’s possible that insiders can sell or pledge their stock 150 days after the deal closes.“The lock-up is meant to stop insiders from selling immediately after the merger,” said Xavier Kowalski, a former partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel who is now a lecturer in the finance department at the University of Florida. “It also stops them from pledging the stock, like with a margin loan. So it’s going to be difficult to find a way to use those shares to get cash for now.”Moreover, there are additional lock-up restrictions contained in an amended charter that experts say appear to include Trump. That lock-up also restricts certain shareholders from immediately selling after the deal closes.“If his shares are covered by the charter’s lockup provisions then, absent an amendment to the charter,\\xa0President\\xa0Trump cannot pledge this stock. Full stop,” Whitehead said.And amending the charter would be tricky – even for Trump and his outsized sway over the company. That’s the kind of thing that would have to be disclosed ahead of time because it would impact potential buyers of the stock.“He can’t do this quietly. If\\xa0President\\xa0Trump today intends to amend the charter and they are not disclosing\\xa0this intention, that’s a problem,” Whitehead said. “Presumably, they would\\xa0need\\xa0to take the position after the vote\\xa0approving the merger that President\\xa0Trump woke up and suddenly said, ‘Hey, let’s amend the charter.’”Now even if Trump overcame these potentially insurmountable obstacles, there is no guarantee any bank would take this stock as collateral in a loan.“If I’m a bank, I’m going to be troubled by the idea of a significant shareholder pledging his stake,” Whitehead said. “Any bank doing a proper credit analysis must be sensitive to the fact that this stock may very well tank if it turns out that President Trump is looking to sell down the position.”This story has been updated with additional developments and context.', 'The nation’s largest credit union said this week that an external review found it hadn’t\\xa0considered race\\xa0in mortgage underwriting, responding to CNN’s previous reporting about racial gaps in its mortgage approval rates.Navy Federal Credit Union, which has more than 13 million members and lends to military servicemembers, Department of Defense personnel, veterans and their families, said a review it commissioned from a civil rights lawyer “found no race-based decision making in our mortgage underwriting” and that “legitimate, non-race factors” had largely explained racial differences in approval rates.A CNN\\xa0investigation\\xa0published in December found that Navy Federal approved more than 75% of the White borrowers who applied for a new conventional home purchase mortgage in 2022 while approving less than 50% of Black borrowers who applied for the same type of loan, according to the most recent federal data available from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans in 2022. The disparity remained even after accounting for more than a dozen different variables available in public mortgage data, including applicants’ income, debt-to-income ratio and property value, CNN’s review found.In addition, an analysis by staff of the Senate Banking Committee, which\\xa010\\xa0Democratic senators cited in a letter\\xa0asking federal regulators to review\\xa0Navy Federal’s mortgage lending earlier this year, also found racial disparities in Navy Federal’s mortgage approval rates based on the publicly available data.Navy Federal said Thursday that an analysis it had commissioned by lawyer Debo Adegbile, a former member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, found that those racial disparities were largely accounted for by examining “all non-public underwriting factors.”“Our review found that when all relevant factors are controlled for, which CNN did not do, the difference in approval rates between Black and White borrowers falls to less than 1%,” Adegbile said\\xa0in a statement. “The remaining difference in approval rates is explained by legitimate, non-race factors like income verification and incomplete credit applications.” The analysis also accounted for other non-public factors including applicants’ credit scores, the statement said.A spokesperson for Navy Federal did not respond to a request for additional details about the analysis.As CNN previously reported, applicants’ credit scores are not available in the public mortgage data, and Navy Federal declined to provide CNN any data that would make it possible to analyze credit scores or other non-public factors.CNN’s analysis only included mortgage applications that were listed in the public data as being fully submitted and either approved or denied, and excluded those that were listed as “closed for incompleteness.” And while Navy Federal’s statement said its analysis included applicants’ debt-to-income ratios, CNN’s review also took those ratios, which are available in the public mortgage data, into account.Navy Federal described Adegbile’s analysis as an “external review,” but his law firm,\\xa0WilmerHale, is also defending Navy Federal in a class-action lawsuit from Black and Latino borrowers who allege the credit union discriminated against them in mortgage applications.The same day that Navy Federal released a statement about the review, other lawyers from WilmerHale filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which had cited CNN’s reporting. Attorneys for the credit union argued that the “alleged statistical disparities” the plaintiffs had cited were not sufficient to prove discrimination, and that they “fail to identify any Navy Federal policy or practice that caused any disparity.”The lawyers also argued that agreements the plaintiffs had signed when they became members of the credit union had required them to give Navy Federal adequate notice before filing a lawsuit, and that most had not done so.Adegbile’s analysis was not included in Navy Federal’s motion to dismiss the case.The plaintiffs’ attorneys – Ben Crump, Adam Levitt, and Hassan Zavareei – said in a statement that it was “a classic conflict of interest” for Adegbile to review Navy Federal’s practices at the same time his firm was defending the credit union in court.“Navy Federal should immediately put out the full investigative report and data analysis so that Navy Federal’s members have an opportunity for themselves to review the findings,”\\xa0the statement\\xa0said.In its statement, Navy Federal also said it was “currently examining initiatives to build on our mission of expanding access to credit for our diverse community of members and continue our efforts to address systemic barriers to homeownership.”', 'This winter, every morning that hotel owner Kelli Doyen looked outside her window, she hoped to see the Gwinn Model Towne Inn’s snowmobile caked in snow.“We are one of only four properties that has a snowmobile trail right off the property,” said Doyen, who co-owns the hotel on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula with her husband.\\xa0In past seasons,\\xa0that competitive advantage lured\\xa0roughly 800\\xa0snowmobilers\\xa0– it’s a top winter\\xa0sport in\\xa0northern\\xa0states\\xa0– to the hotel in Gwinn, Michigan, roughly 20 miles from Marquette.This year, instead of fresh powder, too often Doyen said she saw a muddy path.Now, as the season draws to a close, “We are down 70% over sales from last\\xa0winter,” she said. “We have had a pretty tough go of it.”The 2023-2024 season marked the warmest\\xa0winter\\xa0on record for the lower 48 states, according to NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information. The change in the weather has had an outsize impact on the festivals, events and tourism that define the Great Lakes identity and produce the income of those living and working there. All told, eight states experienced a record-warm season, including Wisconsin, Michigan, New York and Minnesota, plus North Dakota, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire.Instead\\xa0of a\\xa0winter\\xa0wonderland, the past several months have offered tourists less snow, less ice aind less opportunity for\\xa0some outdoor activities. Small businesses owners and regional industries scrambled to adapt. Less outdoor ice skating might mean more indoor ice-skating. Less snow-shoeing meant more pickleball in some places.Doyen said the loss of income amounts to roughly $70,000. She’s one of several business owners in the midwest whose\\xa0winter\\xa0sales keep them afloat until the\\xa0summer\\xa0tourism season begins.\\xa0Since purchasing the property in 2020 - just before Covid hit – Doyen\\xa0said she has invested a bulk\\xa0of her profit into renovations. Operating expenses total $15,000 per month. With the drop in bookings, her husband has pulled from his 401(k) to stay open.“The last six months, I’ve spent every night here because I can’t afford to pay somebody to be here,” Doyen said. “We’re down to our last $20,000 and we have to make it to June.”“It’s depressing. It’s exhausting.”With less snowfall, severe\\xa0drought expanded over portions of Wisconsin and Michigan and increased in Iowa\\xa0during the winter months,\\xa0according to the US Drought Monitor.\\xa0The situation grew so dire that governors in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin announced businesses impacted by drought may be eligible for loans from the Small Business Administration.“From skiing and snowshoeing to winter festivals, snowy winters are part of our way of life in Minnesota,” Gov. Tim Waltz said in a news release in\\xa0March 7.\\xa0“The low precipitation we’ve experienced this winter has had a real economic impact on small businesses that rely on snow and winter tourism to grow and survive.”Susan Estler, CEO of Travel Marquette in Marquette, Michigan, told CNN hotel bookings between Christmas and March are down 16% this year.“We are dependent on the snow for outdoor activities,” Estler said. “Reservations are down. Businesses are down.”Estler estimates roughly 30% of tourism dollars are spent on hotels. That means the other 70% supports the local economy -– from gas stations to grocery stores to restaurants.“All of those things have been impacted,” she said.Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis highlights the significance of climate, and of snow in particular, on business owners’ bottom line. According to the BEA, snow activities in states clustered around the Great Lakes add hundreds of millions of dollars to the region’s economy. For example, Wisconsin snow activities added $83.6 million in 2022, according to the BEA, and roughly $130 million in Michigan the same year.Some events that normally bring throngs of tourists to Marquette were forced to cancel this year. That includes the UP200, a sled-dog race and qualifier for the famous Iditarod race in Alaska.“Safety is our top priority and given the lack of snow and the warm temperatures, we cannot offer a safe race,” said Darlene Welch, UP200 President, in a statement on the UP200 website in February.Estler noted the UP200 still held an\\xa0outdoor\\xa0festival\\xa0instead\\xa0of a race, an example of businesses quickly adapting to what may become a new normal.“The time for adjustment is really now,” she said.  “Hopefully we will be getting an early spring and an early summer so [businesses] can start recouping some of the money that they lost during the winter.”Christopher Germain, CEO of Lake Superior Community Partnership, said some ski areas have been offering summertime kayaking packages and outdoor space for special events and weddings to offset the loss in wintertime revenue. Germain added “Some of our small businesses are pairing up with each other to do special dining events.”Germain, Estler, and Doyen are all transplants who moved to\\xa0northern Michigan enchanted by the majesty of Upper Peninsula winters.“I actually interviewed during the winter, toward the end of January, and it was just breathtakingly beautiful,” Estler said. “The identity of the UP and especially Marquette is very much tied to the winter season and always has been. So, it is quite unusual to have this.”Doyen said one of the most difficult\\xa0parts\\xa0of her hotel’s emptiness is her inability to deliver\\xa0more visitors, activities and, therefore, ancillary\\xa0revenue for her neighbors.“The fact that we have been empty has hurt our community too,” Doyen saidDespite the challenges, Doyen still loves running the Inn, and plans to keep her doors open as long as possible.“We actually care about our guests and care about our community.”Doyen told CNN she also plans to offer a 20 percent discount through the spring months in hopes of bringing in more visitors.Going forward, “You can’t plan around one season anymore,” Germain said.', 'With no winner of the Mega Millions jackpot Friday, the grand prize for Tuesday’s drawing grew past the billion-dollar mark, according to\\xa0the lottery.The jackpot for the next drawing on Tuesday night – an estimated $1.1 billion – marks the first time in seven months that the\\xa0jackpot\\xa0prize has topped $1 billion and only the sixth time in less than six years that the Mega Millions jackpot hit that threshold, according to the lottery.Friday’s winning numbers were: 3, 8, 31, 35, 44 and Mega Ball 16.While there was no big winner Friday, five tickets matched five of the numbers to win the game’s $1 million prize, Mega\\xa0Millions said.

How can you brew hot food and drinks at high altitude? And most important of all, how does a toilet work at 40,000 feet?We often think about how planes work – how they get into the air, and stay there safely. What we think about less are the everyday functions taking place on onboard. Air circulation, heating food and drinks, even flushing the lavatory – it turns out that the more mundane the activity is, the harder it gets to perform it in the air.“It’s pretty remarkable when you start to dig deep,” says Al St. Germain, an aviation industry consultant who’s worked for airlines including Delta and United.“With almost anything on an aircraft, you realize how much goes into it from an engineering perspective – even just getting a meal. Everything is twice as hard on a plane as on the ground.”While safety has always been the driving force for airlines, and the industry’s current buzzword is sustainability (or, rather, making flying less destructive for the environment), St. Germain says that passenger experience, often known as “paxex,” can be what makes travelers pick one airline over another. So how do airlines make magic happen in the air?Using water to flush airplane toilets is a no go because of aircraft weight restrictions. No biggie; instead, planes use air.The standard evac (evacuation) system uses differential air pressure to empty the bowl, in a design originally patented by James Kemper In 1975.Waste tanks – where everything that goes down the toilet ends up – are usually located at the back of the plane, and often at the front, too.When you press the flush button, a valve opens at the bottom of the toilet bowl, connecting it to a pipe below. That pipe – and the waste tank – are pressured, which means that opening the valve creates a vacuum that sucks out what’s in the bowl.“It’s like your vacuum cleaner – it sucks,” says Nigel Jones, an aircraft engineering expert from Kingston University in London who also sits on the accreditation committee of the UK’s Royal Aeronautical Society.“As you press the button, it opens the valve – and as soon as the valve opens, the suction draws it all out. Then the valve closes.”That vacuum effect is going on continuously while the plane is in the air, says Jones – we just don’t hear it until we open the valve and connect the toilet to the system. When the plane is on the ground, however, the differential pressure isn’t there – meaning that the toilet flush is operated by a pump, which creates a vacuum in the tank. As the plane climbs into the air, and the differential pressure in the tank builds, the vacuum naturally forms and the pump stops.Toilet bowls are Teflon coated. “So nothing sticks, and it doesn’t need much at all – the differential pressure clears everything mighty quickly,” says Jones.Airlines choose how many toilets they want in a plane, and where they want them. Jones says that there are minimum numbers per aircraft, depending on size, but airlines can go above those if they want.Of course, a tank that’s filled needs to be emptied – and this is where “honey wagons” come in.These are airport servicing vehicles which empty the tank and take the contents to be processed on airport grounds.It’s a well honed process with 50 years of history – so does that mean things will stay the same forever? Jamco, a Japanese company which currently has a 50% share of the aircraft toilet market, has already pushed boundaries, building onboard bidets for eight airlines including JAL, Al Nippon Airways and Oman Air. They were also first to introduce hygienic touchless flushes and faucets, on the Boeing 787.A spokesperson for the company told CNN: “There are constraints in terms of space, safety requirements, and stringent certifications, making it challenging to introduce new technologies in aircraft interiors.\\xa0However, we are continuously conducting workshops and discussions with various stakeholders to explore next-generation interior products.” In other words – watch this (small, suction-operated) space.Blue ice isn’t just something to be marveled at in Antarctica; it’s also the name given to accidental discharges of airplane sewage.Airplanes have never deliberately shot their toilet waste into the atmosphere, not even in the old days, says Jones. But if a leak occurs in the discharge pipe, since mid-air temperatures are well below freezing, any fluid coming out automatically freezes.“It would get to a point where it’s too heavy to adhere to the toilet servicing panel, so it would fall out and that’s what blue ice was,” he says.This used to be more common until the 1980s, when legislation was introduced to ban taking off with any kind of leak in an aircraft’s toilet system.Accidents still happen – in 2021, a resident near London’s Heathrow airport was “spattered” with excrement. Even worse, it wasn’t even frozen, since the plane was close to the ground and not in freezing temperatures. Luckily that’s a rare occurrence.However, toilets do get blocked relatively often.“It’s only a tiny pipe, and people put things like nappies down – I’ve seen cutlery go down, and [soft drink cans] – they’re fascinated to see whether it will go down or not,” says Jones, who used to work as an engineer for British Airways and saw some spectacularly plugged toilets.But what seems like a harmless experiment can end up delaying your flight.“It can take days to rectify because there’s an awful lot of pipework, and it has to be broken down to find the blockages,” says Jones. “If they have one or two blocked toilets, the aircraft is grounded because you have to have a certain number of toilets.”Oh, and those stories that surface periodically about overflowing toilets? That’ll be because someone has blocked it but failed to report it – so the next time someone uses it, nothing goes down.We’re all quick to criticize plane food, but as plane food enthusiast Nik Sennhauser says, “You have to take into account that you’re in a metal tube at 40,000 feet being catapulted through the air, and the flight attendant is heating up a meal in an oven.”Prepping food to be served on a plane is a complex process with stringent hygiene regulations to be adhered to.Dishes are prepared by catering companies usually based at the airport, before being loaded onto the aircraft. So far, so simple – until you think about having to heat hundreds of meals at the same time. Add in the fact that meals for longhaul flights are often frozen and it becomes even tricker.Most airplane ovens can either use convection or steam to heat, says Jones – and can contain as many as 40 or 50 meals at a time. “On a large aircraft you could have maybe 10 or 12 ovens.” he says.Overnight maintenance crews check that ovens are working as the plane sits on the ground overnight. One time they are kept completely off is during take-off.“The aircraft needs all the power it can get from the engines to take off,” he says. “They don’t put the ovens on till they’re airborne because of the load on the electrical system. Once it’s cruising, it’s fine.”Chillers and freezers run on a different circuit – so they never turn off. Just as well, since that would be a recipe for food poisoning.Have you ever heard advice not to drink tea or coffee on a plane?A 2019 study of the drinking water on 11 major US carriers, which rated water from one to five, showed that only three scored a three or above – considered acceptable. Only one regional airline made the grade.Non-bottled water is sourced from an onboard cold water tank, which provides water for the entire plane, from the toilets to the galleys.The typical advice is to avoid coffee, tea and ice, but Jones is less bothered. Any hot water will have been heated to a point that kills most bacteria, and water is often treated before being added to the tank, he says. Water loaded onto a Boeing 787 is treated with UV light as it’s pumped aboard, for example.Having said that, Jones adds, “The drink is only as good as the water that is provided.”As for getting it nice and steaming, water from the tank is poured via a faucet and heated in “bev [beverage] makers” which heat the water and then keep it warm on hot plates.Despite the grim warnings of “never drink coffee on a plane,” Kris Major, a flight attendant and chair of the European Transport Workers’ Federation Joint Aircrew Committee, says he’s not worried about downing water-based drinks onboard.“I’m happy to drink water on the aircraft of my operator and – without being prejudiced because I’m only aware of the regulations in my part of the world – those in Europe and the UK,” he says.“Any potable water should be fit for human consumption, and with tank-cleaning a requirement, there is no problem.”Many of us take internet access for granted in our daily lives. Some of us even take inflight internet access for granted. But just how easy is it to keep a connection going as you’re whizzing through the sky at 500 mph?“It’s pretty easy technology – you have an antenna that sits on top of the aircraft and continually points at satellites in what’s called the geostationary arc,” says Don Buchman, general manager and vice president of commercial aviation at Viasat, which provides Wi-Fi for almost 10,000 flights per day at up to around 100 MB per second.What sounds like easy tech for him – Buchman has an engineering background – sounds rather more complex for the rest of us, though.Planes equipped for Wi-Fi with Viasat are receiving from satellites over 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) above the Earth, located along the equator.Getting them up there – to levels called the “geostationary arc” or orbit – takes anything from 30 days to six months. But as Buchman says, once they’re in orbit, it’s simple. That high altitude means that each satellite can “see” about a third of the Earth, meaning you could technically fly around the globe connecting to just three satellites – although Viasat has 18.Because each satellite covers such a vast area, it means that planes aren’t constantly disconnecting and reconnecting as they fly. Buchman says that a transcontinental US flight, for example, might use anything between one and all five of the Viasat satellites positioned nearest North America.“Today we can do London to New York City on one, but it depends on the algorithm,” he says, referring to the algorithm Viasat uses to connect aircraft to the best satellite for the flight – bad weather might make the signal from one be better than another, for instance.A Madrid-Rio de Janeiro flight, on the other hand, might cross two or three satellites, as it dips from the northern to southern hemisphere and crosses the Atlantic.When the antenna disconnects from one satellite and links to another, Buchman wagers that passengers rarely notice.“It’s almost always imperceptible – you don’t have to log back in, there’s no real break in connection. The worst [you’ll be offline] is a couple of seconds,” he says. Those longer pauses are if the satellites being used are far apart, meaning the antenna needs to repoint from east to west.“Otherwise, it takes place almost instantly,” he says.Speeds can technically reach over 100MB per seconds onboard, he says, but passengers normally experience around 20-40 MBPS. That’s enough for everyone onboard to individually stream Netflix, Buchman says. On the day of the Super Bowl, for example, Viasat estimates that around 100,000 watched it live on 1,800 flights over the four hours that it was showing. Buchman says that companies providing satellite Wi-Fi have to be prepared to operate at those levels.“At hub airports – New York, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago – you have every passenger online, all doing bandwidth-intensive communications. There’s a lot of demand.”The antenna for inflight Wi-Fi doesn’t disturb the essential communications of the plane – Buchman says the tech goes through “rigorous, continuous certification.” The antenna is used only for the Wi-Fi, and usually sits in what’s known as a “ray dome” on top of the plane – “It looks like a hump,” says Buchman. Pilots can also use the Wi-Fi for non-safety-related communications and weather updates, but have a completely different system for essential communications.And while inflight Wi-Fi feels commonplace today, Buchman says it’s a product of the last 20 years or so, kicked off by the launch of the iPhone – a product that, he says, “changed everything.”“Inflight Wi-Fi was a culmination of high demand but at an affordable price, and a quality that was usable.” Viasat antennae have been flying the friendly skies since JetBlue installed Wi-Fi on its planes in 2013.“Onboard connectivity was nice to have 15 years ago – now it’s table stakes,” says St. Germain. British Airways would agree – just this past week, the airline announced free inflight messaging for passengers as part of a $9 billion service upgrade. It joins major airlines including LATAM, Iberia and Southwest in offering free texting services for its passengers. In the US, JetBlue and Delta are leading the free Wi-Fi charge, says Buchman, with American Airlines close behind.It wasn’t just travel restrictions that stopped people traveling when the pandemic started; for many, the idea of sitting in close proximity to strangers who might be harboring disease meant they had no intention of taking a flight, whether or not they were allowed.That’s when airlines – which usually concentrate on publicizing their inflight entertainment and fancy seats – started talking about HEPA filters. These air filters – HEPA stands for “high efficiency particulate air”\\xa0– are standard in two environments: aircraft and operating rooms. According to the US government’s Environmental Protection Agency, they can remove “at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3\\xa0microns.”While many people think the air on a plane is constantly blown around the cabin, Jones says that modern aircraft circulate air in a different way.“In the old days, aircraft used to take air from the engines, so it had to be cooled through through an air conditioning pack,” he says.But newer aircraft – such as the Boeing 787 – don’t use “engine bleed” air. Instead, they have onboard compressors – “one for each ECS, or environmental control system,” says Jones.They take air from an external source and run it through the compressor. The ECS then circulates the air through the cabin, refining it with HEPA filters. Each cabin runs on a different system, meaning crew can turn down the heating in business class if those lie-flat beds are feeling a bit too cozy, but leave economy passengers warm in their thinner blankets.The onboard air circulation of today isn’t just about keeping healthy – it also controls how passengers feel, especially on longhaul flights. “On a 787 the air is changed every three minutes – completely new air – and on the [Airbus] A350 it’s every two to three minutes, with precisely controlled temperature and humidity to make you feel fresh when you get to your destination,” says Jones. It makes a genuine difference, as anyone who’s taken one leg on an older aircraft such as a Boeing 777, followed by the next on a newer aircraft, can attest.“You feel different when you get off – you don’t feel as jet lagged as you thought you might,” says Jones of the newer aircraft.While most people traveling for their hard-earned vacation still book flights depending on the route and price, St. Germain says that small inflight details make a big difference to frequent flyers.“If you’re a road warrior out there 30-40 times a year, it’s about overall experience. That’s where things like meal quality, leg room and onboard connectivity start to play into the experience,” he says.“In the past decade we’ve seen a push for a better product than we saw in prior years.“Airlines are understanding that products can play into the purchase decision more than it has before.”', 'Caitlin Clark stands alone on the Iowa Hawkeyes’ home floor, with 15,000 fans transfixed by the moment — and more than three million viewers watching on television.She drains a free throw. Effortless. Then another. The home crowd erupts.These routine points earlier this month surpassed the all-time college basketball scoring record, for both men and women, launching Clark into the pantheon of the sport.It’s been a season for the ages for Clark, 22, whose talent has fueled a boom in interest in the women’s game as March Madness got underway this week.NBA star Steph Curry called her record-breaking performance “must-see TV” in an interview with CBS earlier this month.Viewers apparently agree.This year, college women’s basketball has had one of its best regular seasons in history, with regular season games averaging 476,000 viewers on ESPN platforms, where it has seen a 37% viewership increase.The audience for women’s college basketball has increased by more than 60% across all national networks, and more than 48% on games shown by the network, where it is averaging a bigger audience than its men’s counterpart, according to Michael Mulvihill, president of insight and analytics at Fox Sports.Clark – a six-foot senior known for both her shooting and passing game – has undoubtedly driven those numbers, said Jon Lewis, who has tracked sports ratings on his website Sports Media Watch since 2006. Lewis compared her to Curry and other transcendent stars, such as LeBron James and Michael Jordan.“These are the type of players that, when they’re playing, people tune in and pay attention to in a way that they don’t for other players,” he said.Clark’s final-season statistics, which helped her top Pete Maravich’s record, also bear similarities to Curry’s last year with Davidson. Clark is averaging 31.9 points a game and 38% from three-point range, while Curry averaged 28.6 points and 39% from deep.While Clark is enticing viewers, women’s college basketball is experiencing growth that can’t only be explained by “Clarkonomics”– as basketball analyst Debbie Antonelli called it – alone.The rise in its popularity is coinciding with an overall increase in the prominence of women’s sports.That rise is due to improved TV coverage – such as featuring games on major networks and in optimal time slots – and the way that young female athletes have used the platform of Name, Image and Likeness, or NIL, which has allowed college and high school athletes to earn income from sponsorships, among other factors.Iowa and Clark have featured in six of the 10-most viewed women’s basketball games this season, all earning more than one million viewers, according to data from SportsMediaWatch.\\xa0\\xa0The most viewed game this season eclipsed any women’s college basketball contest since 1999, when a UConn and Tennessee rivalry matchup had 3.88 million average viewers.While “mainstream” fans have always known programs like UConn and Tennessee, more attention has been focused lately on newer stars, said Melissa Isaacson, an assistant sports journalism professor at Northwestern. Notably, last year’s championship, which averaged nearly 10 million viewers, introduced the country to Iowa’s Clark and LSU’s Angel Reese.The surge in women’s college basketball is also due to more investment in media coverage of women’s sports, said Lewis.For example, this season is just the third year in which the NCAA has attached the\\xa0 “March Madness” branding to the women’s tournament.“A lot of it is, ‘Hey let’s put these games on where people can actually watch them,’” Lewis said. “There’s something real happening in the women’s game that’s not limited to Caitlin Clark and is unique even among women’s sports.”And, as of March 19, fans who went to TickPick to get tickets for the Final Four had purchased six times as many for the women’s final than for the men’s final, the seller said.College women’s basketball players are among the biggest players in the market for Name, Image and Likeness sponsorships.College women’s basketball players are among the biggest players in the market for Name, Image and Likeness sponsorships.NIL is only in its third year and football players make most of the earnings, but female basketball players are also racking in large sponsorships.Sponsorships for college women’s basketball are projected to reach $60 million by the end of the third year of NIL, according to data from Opendorse, a platform that arranges brand deals between athletes and sponsors.While Clark, Reese and other women’s stars such as Cameron Brink and Paige Bueckers possess huge followings, top men’s college players, such as Reed Sheppard, Rob Dillingham and Cody Williams – who may be destined for this year’s NBA draft – are seemingly less well-known.Using Instagram followers as a barometer, Dillingham has the most of those men’s players with 669,000, while Clark and Bueckers all have over a million, with Reese boasting 2.7 million.“By making these deals possible …[NIL] has shed more light on the individuals and, by proxy, on their sports,” said Sam Weber, who heads communications at Opendorse.There was even speculation that Clark might stay in college rather than entering the WNBA draft to retain her lucrative NIL deals. Bueckers of UConn, for example, chose to stay for a fifth year of eligibility granted by the league to players affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.One factor driving the speculation that Clark might stay in college was that WNBA doesn’t have the same platform as women’s college basketball.While Clark and Reese played for nearly 10 million viewers in last year’s college championship, Game 4 of the WNBA finals peaked with 1.3 million viewers, averaging 889,000. The full four-game series averaged 728,000 viewers, according to data from Sports Media WatchThe WNBA has historically had a smaller audience than college women’s basketball, according to Lewis. That’s in part because it hasn’t been around as long: By the league’s first season, in 1997, several college women’s programs had already developed strong fan bases, Isaacson said.But there’s a precedent for college stars bringing large audiences with them to the WNBA. Five-time Olympic gold medalist, all-time WNBA scoring leader and three-time WNBA champion Diana Taurasi’s first game in 2004 was the most-watched game on ESPN/ABC, according to Lewis.Three-time WNBA champion and two-time gold medalist Candace Parker’s first game in 2008 also drew large audiences, Lewis added.Ticket prices to watch the Indiana Fever – the team eyeing Clark for its No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft – have more than doubled.The crescendo to Clark’s college career could come in the form of a national title. But if that result remains elusive, she will have transcended the college game — and brought legions of newly engaged viewers along with her.', 'Two months after revealing his terminal cancer diagnosis, Sven-Göran Eriksson remains upbeat, approaching his life with the sort of tenacity required when holding perhaps the most demanding job in football.“The doctor is saying I’m not okay, but I feel rather okay,” Eriksson tells CNN Sport. “I have what I have, so I know that it’s a cancer and you can’t cure it. You have to try to stop it as much as possible. That’s it. But I’m okay.”The former England manager announced in January that he has “about a year” to live having been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.After a long managerial career spanning more than 40 years, he is now back home in his native Sweden, undergoing treatment and reflecting on his significant contribution to the game.“The treatment is going fine,” says Eriksson. “It’s up and down, of course. Sometimes, it’s growing a little bit; sometimes, it’s going backwards a little bit.“It’s some sort of a fight, but I’m not sitting in a corner crying. I live the life as I lived before, almost. And it’s okay. I’m still on my feet.”Eriksson won club titles with IFK Göteborg in Sweden (including the 1981/82 UEFA Cup, now known as the Europa League), Lazio in Italy, and Benfica in Portugal as part of his globe-trotting managerial career, but it’s his almost six years spent with England for which he is best remembered by many.Eriksson became the Three Lions’ manager, the team’s first overseas appointment, after four successful years with Lazio, guiding the club to only its second – and still its most recent – Serie A title in 2000. His next job, however, would be the toughest of his career.He took England’s “Golden Generation” – the likes of David Beckham, Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard – to three major tournaments between 2001 and 2006, though never progressed beyond the quarterfinal stage.“England is something special,” says Eriksson. “I don’t know if football was born in England, but more or less … and the Premier League is the best league in the world today. To be the England coach, it’s a big, big job … probably the biggest in the world.”After the prime minster, so the saying goes, the manager of the national team is the most important person in England. And with great power comes great scrutiny – not least at the hands of the tabloid press.Eriksson’s personal life was often the topic of front-page interest on national newspapers in England, notably over a number of alleged affairs.The country’s tabloid press, Eriksson says, is not “a mirror of the English people,” and the way his personal life became embroiled in national news was a facet of the job to which he unhappily had to resign himself.“When you talk about paparazzi and that kind of press, you can’t do anything about it,” he adds. “You have to accept it or go back home to Sweden.“I said to myself: ‘No, Sven. Don’t give up just because of this. Don’t worry about it and don’t read it and don’t talk about it.’ It’s up to the press if they want to write it or not. And at the end, I couldn’t care less.”Despite the media glare and disappointment at major tournaments, Eriksson also enjoyed euphoric moments with England.A 5-1 win away against Germany in 2001 was followed by a sensational Beckham free-kick against Greece a few weeks later. The curling, long-range effort – virtually the last act of the game – ensured England drew 2-2 and qualified for the World Cup.“That was a beautiful goal,” Eriksson remembers. “That’s what the captain should do, and he did it.”The 76-year-old speaks fondly of the “beautiful” excitement in England before a major tournament and believes that the current team has an excellent chance of winning this year’s European Championships in Germany under manager Gareth Southgate, three years after losing the final against Italy.“I can’t see any team which is much better,” says Eriksson. “It could be France, maybe; Spain are not as good as they were; Germany – you never know about Germany. But looking at the squad, the team England can put on the pitch, I think they are very, very strong.”News of Eriksson’s cancer diagnosis has been met with an outpouring of love and support from the football community, both in England and around the world.A lifelong Liverpool fan, he has been invited to coach the club for a legends match against Ajax on Saturday, fulfilling his dream of managing the English Premier League club. That will be one final chance for Eriksson to do what he has done for much of his life: sit on the bench, soak up the atmosphere and do his best to inspire his players to beat the opposing team.“Of course, sometimes you are lucky, sometimes you’re doing well, sometimes you have injuries, the team doesn’t work and things like that,” he says of his time as a manager.“It’s a lot of things, but the stress is always there. I loved that stress, and I miss that stress … Football is a drug, especially if you are involved in it in a heavy way.”It’s been five years since Eriksson’s last formal coaching job with the Philippines national team, but it seems fitting that he should get his managerial send-off at a club he has long admired and in a country with which he has a special connection.The support he’s received from the football-supporting public, he says, has been “beautiful” and touching.“I’m a little bit lucky – they’re telling me how good I was when I’m still alive,” Eriksson jokes. “Normally, it’s after the funeral you hear that. So, I’m okay. I shall not complain.”', 'Shohei\\xa0Ohtani’s Los Angeles Dodgers brought Major League Baseball (MLB) to South Korea on Wednesday night, overshadowing Seoul hometown star Kim Ha-seong’s San Diego Padres in a 5-2 victory.The first clash of the two-game Seoul Series opened the MLB season and showcased an international appeal brought to the sport by an increasing lineup of Asian stars led by\\xa0two-way Japanese star Ohtani, who joined the Dodgers in the offseason, signing the richest deal ever made by a major leaguer.Earlier on Wednesday, South Korea police said they had received a report about an email threatening to detonate a bomb during the game to hurt Ohtani.About 150 police officers were dispatched to the stadium to search for any threats, but they found no explosives.Clearly, thousands of those in Seoul’s Gocheok Skydome were there to see\\xa0Ohtani, who delivered two hits, an RBI and a stolen base to please the crowd.Ohtani’s wife – Japanese basketball player Mamiko Tanaka – was also in attendance, with the ESPN broadcast showing her giving high fives to some of the women in nearby seats after one of her husband’s hits.Ohtani may be the biggest name in baseball worldwide, but in South Korea, the top billing belongs to Padres shortstop Kim Ha-seong.The Korean star garnered the biggest cheers from the crowd and his San Diego team clearly was the home team – and it deserved to be. After all, the Skydome used to be Kim’s home stadium when he played for the Kiwoom Heroes in the Korea Baseball Organization’s (KBO) League.When Padres starter Yu Darvish got out of a bases-loaded jam with a strikeout in the top of the third inning, the stadium erupted with applause.But when the Dodgers loaded the bases again in the eighth inning with no outs, it was too much for the Padres to turn back, as the LA team erupted for four runs to seal the win.The Dodgers rally drew loud cheers from the fans, demonstrating a local excitement that MLB decided to bring its biggest star to Seoul to start the season.This was an MLB game that showcased Asia both on and off the diamond. Not only were the most popular players Asian, the between-innings entertainment featured each team’s cheerleaders performing K-pop routines.Korean fan Park Jun-hyuk said he was at the stadium to see\\xa0Ohtani.Ohtani\\xa0“is like the best player you’d see in 100 years. And the fact that such a player is in South Korea as a Dodgers player to play in the opening game is so meaningful that I decided to come here,” Park told CNN.Motoki Sato, a 26-year-old from Japan, said he’s followed\\xa0Ohtani\\xa0since he was a high school star, though this was his first time to see\\xa0the two-way superstar in person. It was also Sato’s first Dodgers game.“Previously, I supported the Angles, the team where\\xa0Ohtani\\xa0was at,” Sato said as he smiled.He was wearing Dodger colors on Wednesday, like thousands of others in the crowd, many of them scoring their merchandise in a souvenir tent outside the stadium before gametime.More than two hours before the first pitch, a line wound around the MLB merchandise tent as staff let fans inside in groups to prevent crowding in the store. Anybody wearing team merchandise had it tagged before going in.Inside, less expensive souvenirs were mostly sold out, while the prized\\xa0Ohtani\\xa0number jerseys were pulled off the shelves almost as soon as they were displayed.The Padres side of the store was less frenzied, but still busy. South Korea’s Kim was a favorite.The Seoul Series, a two-game series between the two teams, features the first MLB regular-season games played in Korea. It’s the ninth time that MLB has opened its season outside the 50 US states and Canada. The last time that happened was in 2019, when the Oakland Athletics faced the Seattle Mariners in Tokyo.Chan Ho Park, who 30 years ago became the first Korean player in MLB when he was with the Dodgers, threw the ceremonial first pitch.Padres shortstop Kim, who is from Bucheon (about 15.5 miles away from Seoul), received a warm ovation from the crowd for his first at-bat in the bottom of the second inning.He was making his return to the ballpark where he played for the Kiwoom Heroes. He acknowledged the crowd by raising his batting helmet. Kim went 0-for-3 with a walk on the night.Brenda and Gerardo Marquez had traveled from San Diego to Seoul for the two-game series, lucky winners of tickets for reserved for Padres fans.They had to see Kim play in his home country.“It’s all about Ha-Seong Kim for us tonight, so looking for that win and to see him here at home,”\\xa0said Brenda Marquez.Gerardo said the couple, who came to Seoul with their three young daughters, made reservations to be here even before they won the ticket lottery.The Padres might have lost, but the trip was still a win-win for the Marquez family. Their daughters are huge BTS fans – “obsessed with them,” said Gerardo – while Brenda said she would have been satisfied to be just near the stadium.“We would have just walked around outside if we hadn’t gotten (tickets),” she said after her family got to see Kim on his home turf – and those K-pop routines between innings.', 'Welsh rugby union star Louis Rees-Zammit turned heads earlier this year when he announced that he would be leaving behind the sport he made his name in to try his luck at making it into the National Football League.After all, the 23-year-old was one of rugby’s most promising names and had already made 32 international appearances for Wales, scoring 14 tries. In 2021, aged 20 years and 93 days old, he became the youngest player since 1959 to be selected in the British and Irish Lions squad. He starred at club level for English side Gloucester and was one of Welsh rugby’s poster boys.A future at the top of the sport seemed all but guaranteed, but Rees-Zammit chose to leave the security of rugby for the NFL International Player Pathway (IPP), a decision that comes with no guarantees of making it to the league.“I fancy a new challenge and what a better challenge than to be in the NFL,” Rees-Zammit told CNN’s Coy Wire. “I’ve been training really hard for seven or eight weeks now and I think I’m in a good position. I feel smooth, I feel comfortable and I’m ready to show everyone what I can do.”Rees-Zammit has been training and living at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida alongside the 2024 cohort of IPP athletes, getting to grips with a new sport as he prepares for his Pro Day on March 20, where he will perform drills and athletic tests for NFL evaluators.Despite never playing football at a professional or organized level, Rees-Zammit is familiar with the game having watched the sport from a young age.“My dad as a teenager in the UK, he always played American football,” Rees-Zammit explained. “It was pretty tough for him back then though to get over to the States and go to college and try and go through that system.“I kind of want to continue his legacy and go beyond and inspire a lot of people back home to be able to make this change and, you know, have the confidence to do it as well.”Rees-Zammit is aiming to play on offense and said that it would be a “dream come true” to play wide receiver or running back in the NFL.He compares his style of play to that of Deebo Samuel and Christian McCaffrey of the San Francisco 49ers – versatile players who can take over games running the ball but are also adept route runners and pass catchers.Rees-Zammit revealed that his favorite NFL player growing up was three-time Pro Bowl receiver DeSean Jackson and used to watch his highlights on YouTube as a teenager.Like Jackson, Rees-Zammit is also known for his blistering speed. He has earned the nickname ‘Rees-Lightning’ and reportedly clocked a top speed of 24.2 miles-per-hour during a rugby game. For comparison, the fastest ball-carrier in NFL last season was the Seattle Seahawks’ DK Metcalf, who reached 22.23 mph.His speed could end up making him a useful weapon on special teams as a kick returner or alternatively as a gunner – rugby players are required to play both offense and defense, so Rees-Zammit is no stranger to tackling.There is no doubt that ‘LRZ’ is frighteningly quick – even by the NFL’s lofty standards – and has been described as a “freak” athlete by his former Wales coach Warren Gatland, but adjusting to the game, let alone making it to the league, takes more than just having raw athletic ability.“I think a lot of it is being able to accelerate and decelerate at such speed,” said Rees-Zammit when asked about what the biggest challenge was in adapting from rugby to football. “In rugby, you don’t really have to do that too often.“It’s been an adjustment I’ve had to make but over the past seven weeks. If you were to see my footage from week one compared to now, I’m very happy with it. The coach is very happy with that.”However, coming to terms with the mental side of the game, learning the X’s and O’s and memorizing plays are just as, if not more important than being an exceptional athlete.The biggest success story of the IPP is Jordan Mailata, the starting left tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles.An Australian former rugby player with no prior experience playing football, Mailata came through the pathway to be selected in the seventh round of the 2018 NFL Draft and signed a contract extension with Philadelphia in 2021 worth $64 million with a max of $80 million and $40.85 million guaranteed.It was a long journey for Mailata however, who said that he “didn’t know where to begin” when he was handed an Eagles playbook for the first time and that it “felt like a different language.”Unlike Mailata, Rees-Zammit has a head start in that he was an NFL fan before joining the IPP and said that he is conscious of the mental requirements.“I know how much you have to know,” said the Welshman. “It’s a lot more than rugby, but at the same time, having an idea of the game and being able to actually put what you learn onto the field, that’s not really gonna be new to me. It’s just gonna be the quantity of plays.”Rees-Zammit also believes that some of his experience on the rugby field will aid him on the gridiron, helping to spot gaps in opposing defenses and win one-on-one matchups out wide.There is no doubting the 23-year-old’s confidence, despite the fact that his chances of making an NFL roster are arguably slim. In a sport loaded with speedy athletes, he is unlikely to stand out based on his athleticism alone and his lack of experience is a significant hurdle to overcome.“There aren’t a lot of people who make it in the NFL who haven’t been brought up with the game and played it at a young age,” Gatland said earlier this year.But none of that fazes Rees-Zammit, who is committed to making his dream into a reality and told CNN that he has no fears about the step that he is taking.“Whenever I went out and played in rugby, I had no fear,” he said. “My first coach told me to go out there when you get an opportunity, have no fear and express yourself.So that’s what I’m always gonna do. And I’ve worked really hard for the past seven weeks and I’m gonna continue to do that.”', '“Ireland, we are at war,”\\xa0UFC star Conor McGregor declared to his millions of social media followers on November 22, 2023.It’s not clear precisely what McGregor was referring to, but this post, was viewed more than 19 million times on X, formerly known as Twitter. It was later followed by a series of tweets about immigration which were then circulated amongst Telegram channels, seen by CNN to have links to the far-right.As far back as 2022, McGregor had expressed his support for people protesting against immigration.The day after McGregor’s war tweet, a stabbing outside a school in central Dublin left three children and an adult injured. Hours later, rioters with links to the far-right descended on the city.While local media later reported the alleged attacker was a naturalized Irish citizen who came to Ireland from Algeria in 2003, misinformation alleging the assailant was a foreign national had quickly spread online.Ciarán O’Connor, a senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches online hate and disinformation, told CNN that the far-right has grown in Ireland because of social media platforms such as X and Telegram which are commonly used by extremists.“The far-right are promoting McGregor as the voice of the people, taking advantage of his platforms to boost their ideology,” O’Connor told CNN, adding that\\xa0he believes\\xa0McGregor’s “tweets in the lead up to the riot were a call to action against illegal immigration.”The Telegram channels that had circulated McGregor’s declaration of war the night before the stabbing claimed\\xa0asylum seekers\\xa0posed an innate, existential threat to Ireland’s citizens.According to the Irish government,\\xa0around 500 rioters spilled into the streets of Dublin and the rampage quickly turned violent. Police cars, buses and trams were set on fire. Rioters threw fireworks, flares and bottles injuring police officers, while shops were looted causing “tens of millions” of euros in damage.One protester could be seen on video holding a sign reading “Irish Lives Matter,” while others were heard chanting anti-immigrant slogans, as “get them out” reverberated around the nation’s capital in a night of violence.Paul Murphy, a TD – a member of the Irish parliament – from the People Before Profit party, who has had members of the far-right protest outside his home in Dublin for his outspoken\\xa0support of refugees, told CNN that “in terms of active members of the far-right, there’s between 200 to 300 between all far-right organizations: national, freedom party, Ireland first – form a multitude of micro far-right parties.”Despite Ireland’s two far-right parties, the Irish National Party and the Irish Freedom Party, respectively received around\\xa00.2% and 0.3% of the vote in the 2020 general election, Murphy said the far-right are a small but growing minority.This comes after the Garda – as Ireland’s police are known – told CNN there were 231 anti-immigration related public gatherings in 2023.After the riot on November 23, 2023, police\\xa0commissioner\\xa0Drew Harris said, “What is clear is that people have been radicalized through social media,” before describing rioters as “a complete lunatic hooligan faction driven by far-right ideology.”As riots raged in Dublin, McGregor, posted on X, “You reap what you sow.”Local media reported this triggered a police investigation into the UFC star and others for allegedly “inciting hatred online.” The Garda told CNN that they would not comment on McGregor’s case.McGregor also took to social media to suggest\\xa0that he might run for [Irish] President. The seriousness of his online claim remains unclear, though in a subsequent post McGregor positioned himself as providing “fresh skin in the game.”“These parties govern themselves vs govern the people … I listen. I support. I adapt. I have no affiliation/bias/favoritism toward any party. They would genuinely be held to account regarding the current sway of public feeling … It would not be me in power as President, people of Ireland. It would be me and you,” said McGregor.McGregor did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. However, following the Dublin riot the 35-year-old told the Guardian in a statement that, “We Irish are known for our beautiful hearts, and we have a proud history of not accepting racism.”The rise of McGregor is one of the most famous rags-to-riches stories in sports.A working-class boy from Dublin, McGregor was driven by a desire to become world champion in a sport relatively unknown in Ireland.As he started winning fights, the MMA octagon became McGregor’s colosseum. He entertained spectators with his precise boxing style and his quick wit charmed an ever-growing fan base.“The Notorious” Conor McGregor brand was born and, before long, he was the first person in history to hold two UFC belts simultaneously,\\xa0rising to become the world’s highest paid sport star in 2021, according to Forbes.Yet McGregor was dogged by accusations of sexual assault, which he has denied, while a string of defeats to Khabib Nurmagomedov, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Dustin Poirier left the fighter with one\\xa0title victory in the last eight years.With his fighting career in flux, McGregor has turned his attention to sparring with people on social media, which has touched a nerve in Ireland’s political establishment.Political analysts and far-right experts have told CNN that McGregor’s unique brand of Irish patriotism that won him supporters as a fighter has mutated into a strand of “far-right” Irish nationalism.“Far-right figures who do promote ethnonationalism – of Ireland for the Irish – celebrate when McGregor is becoming more aligned with their brand of nationalism,” O’Connor said.McGregor has become “a vocal anti-immigration influencer and is using his enormous reach and influence to encourage hostility and suspicion of migrants and asylum seekers,” he added.McGregor has been accused by some Irish politicians of fanning the flames of discontent online, voicing his anger at Ireland’s immigration policy and asking questions that strike at the core of Irish consciousness: does Ireland, a country with its long history of emigration, remain a country that welcomes people seeking refuge?“I think these tweets are incredibly irresponsible for someone who has ten million followers on Twitter alone to be whipping up this level of poison and hate,” Labour Justice spokesperson Aodhán Ó Ríordáin told RTÉ News last year. McGregor has said he’s being made a “scapegoat.”The former UFC champion appears to have picked his corner, in the fight for Ireland’s soul, but whether he is willingly or unwillingly platforming “far-right” views remains unclear.“When he first came to prominence in 2012, he got attention by acting like a clown – and people received him well,” Ewan MacKenna, who authored the book “Chaos is a Friend of Mine: The Life and Crimes of Conor McGregor,” told CNN.“He will become whatever the crowd wants him to be and he molds himself into whatever brings him the most attention, and with politics, it would be similar.”McGregor has previously claimed he regularly deletes his posts on X for “personal” reasons but has also said: “My statements, widely publicised, stand.”McGregor’s UFC slogan was once: “When one of us go to war, we all go to war,” and the MMA fighter has continued to evoke war imagery in recent months.“McGregor, when he first came onto the [MMA] scene, he used his sense of Irishness to portray an image of a fighting Irish warrior, but in the last couple of months, he has pivoted this towards ethno-nationalism and this idea that Ireland must protect itself from refugees,” said O’Connor.In a later post, now deleted by McGregor, the fighter reacted to footage of a bus of asylum seekers, writing: “People of the community are not told who these men are. Or why they are here. This is what I mean when I say we are at war. You cannot expect the people of Ireland to tolerate this. We will not.”In a separate, now deleted post on X, the UFC star said: “Do not let any Irish property be took over unannounced. Evaporate said property. It’s a war.”Since November 2018 , there have been a number of instances when properties or locations linked,\\xa0 to the housing of people seeking asylum or international protection were set on fire, according to analysis by Irish media.The UFC star, in a now deleted post, said: “I stand with the people of the East Wall,” in reference to protests which started in Dublin’s East Wall district in November 2022 over plans to house refugees in a disused office block. McGregor’s tweet was then circulated widely in Telegram channels with links to the far-right.Ireland, a country of just over five million people, saw 141,600 immigrants arrive on its shores in the year leading up to April 2023 – the highest figure in 16 years with some attracted by its strong economic performance (9.4% real GDP growth in 2022), according to the Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO).In 2020, Ireland was ranked in the Migration Policy Index’s top 10 of countries for having “a comprehensive approach to integration, which fully guarantees equal rights, opportunities and security for immigrants and citizens.”But for many ordinary workers,\\xa0the benefits are failing to reach their pockets\\xa0and they struggle are struggling to afford high housing prices and rents.This leaves many without a stake in society, or a home to live in, and so Ireland is often seen as a nation of exiles, with more than 64,000 people leaving its shores to try their hand at a life elsewhere over the same time period.Matthew Donoghue, a professor in social policy at University College Dublin, told CNN socio-economic inequality can create a “sense of insecurity that the far-right have become adept at exploiting for their own gain, scapegoating people and groups who are facing exactly the same pressures.”“The pressures people feel can be a result of complex political, economic and social factors but instead the far-right offer a simple - but incorrect - narrative of blame,” he added.In November, McGregor shared, before unsharing, an X post by anti-immigration Irish influencer Mick O’Keefe about residents in rural Ireland putting up a checkpoint to deter asylum seekers from entering local areas.O’Keefe regularly writes to McGregor on X, calling him “President McGregor.” O’Keefe did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.AI-generated images of McGregor have also circulated online, showing him bare-chested, holding a rifle and leading a mob of armed Irishmen.In one video posted on X, Keith Woods, an Irish anti-immigration influencer, lambasts Ireland’s new hate speech laws, claiming they are a way to silence people speaking out against immigration.The same video then shows an AI-generated image of McGregor wearing a crown on his head, wrapped in an Irish tricolor.Woods has appeared on far-right agitator Nick Fuentes’ “America First” show. During a separate show, Fuentes – an American White nationalist and Holocaust denier – said that McGregor should “rise up” and “salvage [Ireland] because it’s going to be either the Irish or it’s going to be the Blacks,” before adding: “Only one side is going to come out of this thing alive.”McGregor, who follows Woods on X, has liked his posts in the past, including one where Woods quoted Irish 1916 patriot Padraig Pearse saying, “Ireland belongs to the Irish.”The phrase has become the new slogan of the far-right Irish National Party, for which Woods has been seen canvassing and holding the party’s banner.Woods did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.As recently as 2019, Foreign Policy said that Ireland was one of Europe’s “last countries without extreme nationalists in parliament.”But the Dublin riots and subsequent protests have cast the spotlight on the emergence of a new right-wing strain of politics and its amplification on social media.Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told CNN that “far-right groups in Ireland are harnessing Twitter (now known as X) to spread their messages in the same way far-right groups do so in other parts of the EU.”But she added: “It is true that Ireland’s far right is less developed than in places like Germany and France, where there are rising political parties of this persuasion, or in Italy, Sweden, and other countries where the far right is part of the governing majority.”Donoghue added, “there is a larger (yet small) base of committed activists using social media, especially that they are able to organize more effectively than before. However, it is very important to note that they are roundly rejected by the vast majority of the Irish population.”', 'Writing in 1863, the French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire turned his eye to a striking faction of Parisian and English high society, one militantly fanatical for appearances — so much that some were said to polish their boots with Champagne. “Dandyism is a mysterious institution,” he said of the cult of the fastidiously-dressed, 19th-century male, “no less peculiar than the duel.”Though himself no stranger to decadence — with a predilection for satin, velvet and changing his hair on a whim, Baudelaire squandered an inheritance with his louche taste for clothing and opium — he identified in the dandy’s subversive character a “burning desire to create a personal form of originality.”Scores of subcultures have embraced and interpreted the archetype in the decades since. Rather than Beau Brummell’s crisply-tied cravat, today the term “dandy” may summon visions of Harry Styles in a string of freshwater pearls or playwright Jeremy O. Harris’ natty Thom Browne suiting. But its preening, self-curated elegance remains, beyond limits of the gender binary or preconceived notions of how one “should” dress.“There’s not one definitive description,” observed the British artist Sarah Ball in a video call with CNN. “Gender norms are so blurred now, fantastically. It’s a moving scale, wherever we choose to be.”The concept of the dandy in the twenty-first century — and how it may be defined or disrupted — is the connective thread of Ball’s first New York solo exhibition, “Tilted,” which debuted at Stephen Friedman Gallery in Tribeca earlier this year. Comprising 10 large-scale, tightly composed portraits in Ball’s signature airy stretches of color, the show challenges conventions of gender and celebrates the exuberance of self-expression.Each of the personalities represented in “Tilted” is dressed in their own idiosyncratic accoutrements, rendered in minute detail: rakish beribboned headgear, delicate lace collars and bonnets, expressive makeup, oversized eyewear and, in one instance, even a cocktail glass, holding a slosh of liquid and the briny green of a Castelvetrano olive. Ball — who works from a studio in the small English town of St Ives, Cornwall, where artists have been drawn to the light and the sea for generations — typically finds her subjects through social media or on the street, attracted by their “degree of complete individuality,” she told CNN.Exploring the dandy persona has been a natural development for Ball, whose work needles the tension between self-identity and the performance of outward presentation.\\xa0“It’s part of a much bigger idea: how we are defined by others or how we define ourselves. That can be anything — race, ethnicity, or religion, or sexuality or gender fluidity,” she told CNN. “I’ve always been very interested in how we present a version of ourselves externally; how our personality manifests itself.”For all the wit in the clothes, there is a stillness and a surreal quality in Ball’s portraits that place her subjects slightly out of time. “That is definitely something I seek when I’m looking for people to paint,” she said. Indelible personal style is also crucial to the allure. Ball doesn’t costume her subjects, though she edits details to balance the composition. “They’re ready-made, in a way,” she explained, “but then the painting really does take over.”At over eight feet tall, “Declan (In Simone Rocha With Eddie),” depicts an individual in a sumptuous, crystal-embroidered smock dress by the Irish designer, known for her rebellious take on historic ritual, “feminine” codes and gender play. Accompanied by their long-haired guinea pig Eddie, swaddled in a lace-edged handkerchief, Declan’s coiffed shag haircut could read 18th century Flanders — or any contemporary hipster enclave, be it in Brooklyn or Berlin.An encounter with the writer Andrew Solomon’s 2004 essay Dandyism, published years before Instagram and other social media became the de facto avenue for exhibitionist display, influenced the body of work, according to Ball. “I’ve always looked (at) and used historical archives as a way of connecting with what’s happening in the world at the moment,” Ball said. “It’s a bit tongue in cheek, but the idea of ‘promenade’ in showing oneself peacocking is the same as people use social media for, really.” (Cue Solomon, quoting the French novelist Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly, “To appear to be is to be for Dandies.”)Two figures in the show, Von and Henry, materialize in multiple guises, demonstrating the transformativeness of persona construction and the depth of what may lie beyond the surface. “I’m aware that Instagram allows us to curate an image, an idea of ourselves, but unless you know that person, you don’t really ever know whether that’s true,” Ball noted. “There’s that intersection where truth meets fiction.”Her interpretations on the dandy shows how mutable and fluid the persona is, as Ball name-checks a series of female inspirations for the ‘look;’ the outré trouser suits and cropped bobs introduced by designer Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel, screen cipher Marlene Dietrich and Sandy Powell, the flame-haired, bespectacled costume designer known for her collaborations with directors Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes.What remains is pure individual verve. “I’ve always been drawn to people that have not followed one path or another…who are extroverts, theatrical, unusual, creative, and wonderful,” Ball said.', 'Diamonds are forever – especially for Emily Ratajkowski, who has chosen to turn her engagement ring into something entirely new following her split from her film producer husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard.With the help of Alison Chemla, creative director of jewelry brand Alison Lou, Ratajkowski worked to remake her old engagement ring, which featured a pear-shaped and a princess-cut diamond, into two separate rings.“The rings represent my own personal evolution,” the model told Vogue. “I don’t think a woman should be stripped of her diamonds just because she’s losing a man.”Now, the pear-shaped diamond sits on Ratajkowski’s pinkie finger, while the princess cut has been flanked by more trapezoid stones and turned into a new sparkler.Ratajkowski went on to explain that she got the idea after reading Stephanie Danler’s story “The Unravelers” in The Paris Review.“(It) includes the story of her grandmother’s snake ring—a ring that is made up of the different stones from her various marriages,” said Ratajkowski, who was catapulted to fame after she appeared in the music video for Robin Thicke’s 2013 track “Blurred Lines.”“I loved the idea of a ring unabashedly representing the many lives a woman has lived.”The model, who shares a son with Bear-McClard, added that creating the rings was a “fun project” to work on “amidst a hugely transitional period in my life.”“The ring became symbolic to me—some kind of token or evidence of my life becoming my own again,” she said.“Somehow, these rings feel like a reminder that I can make myself happy in ways I never imagined,” she added.', 'Celebrated architect Norman Foster has unveiled plans for a new $1-billion office tower in \\ufeffLos Angeles that will see greenery spilling out from a series of terraces spiraling up its facade.The eye-catching proposal, which was formally submitted to city planning authorities this week, will transform a two-acre site on Hollywood’s Sunset Boulevard into a 22-story entertainment industry workplace dubbed The Star.Digital impressions of the high-rise, released by the British architect’s firm Foster + Partners on Wednesday, show elevated gardens bursting with plants and trees, as well as outdoor decks and modern office space.In a statement, Foster described it as a “true reflection of the workplace of the future, nurturing community, wellbeing and collaboration.”Comprised largely of offices and billed as “a modern landmark,”\\xa0The Star will house entertainment firms and “Hollywood’s top content creators,” said Foster + Partners.\\xa0Current plans include production space, a gallery, a screening theater, a rooftop restaurant and “community gathering spaces” at ground level.The proposal, which is set across 525,000 square feet of floor space,\\xa0replaces an earlier plan for the site unveiled in 2019. Designed by MAD Architects, the Chinese firm behind the curvilinear Lucas Museum of Narrative Art (which is set to open in LA next year), the original circular design featured a\\xa0funicular railway wrapping around the exterior.The scheme was reportedly set to cost $500 million, half the price of the new proposal. Asked why the tower’s developer, Maggie Gong Miracle, abandoned the original plan, a spokesperson for the project told CNN that Foster’s new design — which is the same height, but thinner than the previous proposal — was intended to be an\\xa0“asset to the community” that “respected the views” enjoyed by those living in the Hollywood Hills, which overlook the site.The announcement comes as LA’s real estate market struggles to recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hollywood writers strikes and the growth of remote and hybrid working. More than a quarter of the city’s office space — rising to almost 30% in downtown LA — is currently vacant, according to the latest data from property brokerage Savills.Should the city greenlight the proposal, construction on The Star will start by early 2026 and complete in 2029.', 'Within hours of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky invoked martial law across the country, setting in motion an ongoing defence operation and signing a decree to mobilize conscripts. With eligible men aged between 18-60 not being allowed to leave Ukraine, news reports were filled with images of mostly women and young children fleeing the country, wrapped in blankets or with grandparents nearby.Like many of us, in the early days of the war, British photographer Polly Braden’s grasp of what was happening was informed by TV and newspaper coverage. In it, she recognized the correlation between what she was witnessing and her own practice. “I’d made this body of work about single parents (‘Holding the Baby,’ 2022), and seeing these women leaving Ukraine, I thought about everything they were going to have to do to support the children and older people they were bringing with them,” she told CNN in an interview.Weeks after those initial reportage images began being shown, Braden flew to Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine, inspired to work on a new series. “It felt important to record what was going to happen to these women. They were going to have to find housing, schooling, jobs… to build new lives,” she explained. “It also meant they suddenly became refugees — they might have been teachers, lawyers, important people in their community — what was that going to look like for them?” The project would ultimately become an exhibition called “Leaving Ukraine,” currently on display at the Foundling Museum in London.“Of course, it’s important we have pictures of the frontline and what’s happening inside Ukraine, but it’s also important we understand what role women play in war, especially this war, where women have given up their status in their country,” continued Braden, reflecting on the traditionally gendered approach to documenting conflict. “They are safeguarding the next generation of Ukraine.”Spanning two years (the most recent image was taken in early March 2024) and featuring a mix of still photography and moving image, “Leaving Ukraine” closely follows the stories of six women Braden met when she travelled to Moldova: law graduate Lena, pregnant mother Anya, school friends Sofiia, Aliesia and Yuliia, and Narine who left Ukraine with her children and a close friend.Conscious of the work’s broader scope, Braden considers “Leaving Ukraine” not just a depiction of these six women and their families, but also as a reflection of the countries they’ve ended up in, which include Italy, Poland and the UK. According to the UNHCR’s most recent report, Moldova has received over 850,000 Ukrainian refugees and more than 120,000 third country nationals since February 22, 2022. Of them, as of November 12, 2023, more than 113,000 have stayed on in the country.“I thought I’d meet people in a country then follow them building a life there, but not one person I met has landed in a country, found their feet and made it work,” she shared. “They’ve had to move because they can’t find work, there’s no housing, they can’t get their kid to school — or they’ve landed in the countryside in a country they’ve never been to.”Braden describes the project as wholly collaborative, detailing her close work with the women to construct an intimate portrait of their new reality (photographing Anya, for example, just hours after she gave birth). Many of the images are tender studies of private moments, shot in homes, social spaces and on public transport. “They’ve been telling their own story really, I’ve just been holding a camera,” she said.Lena, who Braden recalled had become irritated speaking to journalists in Moldova, later came to live with her in London. The photographer noted how they didn’t take any photos during this period. “I thought it was quite invasive,” she said, reflecting on the trust they’d developed. “After all it’s a privilege, (this work). And finding a new life is like a jigsaw, right?” Lena has since moved out, meeting a partner and having a baby, and Braden is conscious of how the war has affected her family’s trajectory. “The child hopefully will speak Ukrainian, but they’re an English family,” she said.Elsewhere, with two teenagers of her own, the photographer has taken great pleasure in working with the three schoolgirls, one of whom is now studying film in Warsaw and used the project in her coursework. “The most amazing part about following young people, like Sofiia, Aliesia and Yuliia, is they’re optimistic and full of the joys of life,” she said. “Wanting love and all the normal things young people want.”Initially, Braden had envisioned she’d be able to return to Ukraine with some of the women, but with the war now in its third year, that has not yet been possible. Ultimately she determined that the series is about building a life away from home, and “finding new paths in Europe.”Similarly, her commitment to just a small group of families, in tandem with her long-term approach, allowed her to harness greater power in her storytelling. “If we don’t look at individual stories,” she clarified, “then big policies are made without understanding details.”', 'A treasure hunter struggling with faulty equipment has unearthed a gold nugget believed to be the largest ever found in England.Richard Brock discovered the gold nugget, weighing 64.8 grams (2.3 ounces), in the country’s Shropshire Hills near the border with Wales, auction house Mullock Jones said Thursday.The nugget is around the size of a UK 50 pence coin.The find, nicknamed Hiro’s Nugget, has an estimated worth of between £30,000 ($38,000) and £40,000 ($50,700), according to Shropshire-based Mullock Jones, which is handling the sale.However, it almost seemed that luck had eluded Brock, whose equipment almost failed him on the day of the dig.When Brock arrived at the site in Shropshire in May, he discovered that his metal detector was faulty, according to a press release from Mullock Jones.As his hopes dimmed, he turned to a piece of older equipment. At first he found only a coin of little value, but within five minutes he made the shocking discovery, the auction house said.“It just goes to show that it doesn’t really matter what equipment you use, if you are walking over the find and are alert enough to what might be lurking underneath the soil, that makes all the difference,” Brock said in the release.The nugget is considered to be a “rare find,” auctioneer Ben Jones of Mullock Jones told CNN Thursday. How it made it to the dig site is a mystery.Parts of the Shropshire Hills were once under a prehistoric ocean, and pieces of coral are often unearthed there, according to the auction house.“The site does contain an old road/ railway line and has remnants of Welsh stone within,” auctioneer Jones said, adding: “So [there’s] a variety of possibilities of how it made it there.”The auction ends April 1.Although Hiro’s Nugget is believed to be the largest discovered so far in England, several previous finds in other parts of the United Kingdom dwarf it in size.The record holder is the 121.3-gram [4.3 ounces] Reunion Nugget, found in Scotland in 2019.', 'I come from\\xa0a family of\\xa0Russian-Ukrainian tailors, notion peddlers plus a milliner or two and I am fairly certain my ancestors would hold me at least partially responsible for the bankruptcy filing of a major sewing craft store chain this week.Joann Fabrics and Crafts, founded 81 years ago when my seamstress grandmothers still had young children at home, blamed a post-pandemic sales slump for the downturn. The lockdown saw\\xa0sales of sewing machines\\xa0soar and stock sell out. But now that we’re not making our own face masks, or\\xa0working from home\\xa0in nearly the same numbers, many of our DIY urges are apparently on the wane.But it’s more than that.My immigrant great-grandparents taught their children how to make clothes by hand and machine so well that both sets of my grandparents grew up to own and operate small dry cleaning businesses in Chicago, where they also took in dresses, hemmed pants and hung drapes. They had the can-do craftiness of people with practical needs but\\xa0little\\xa0money.Those sorts\\xa0of crafting skills used to be commonplace. Parents passed them down and when\\xa0Silent Generation\\xa0or early Boomer parents could not or did not, home economics teachers did. Most people (OK, most women) who attended public junior high schools in the 1960s,\\xa01970s or even\\xa01980s learned at least basic sewing skills and could advance them with elective classes in high school. Boys were welcome to attend, too, although I don’t recall any wearing aprons or thimbles alongside me.Unfortunately, those sorts of classes weren’t available to my now college-age kid, who attended public schools from start to finish. She says there was an after-school sewing club but nothing in the curriculum. Ditto shop class, which seems to be history, too.But if\\xa0cars are expensive\\xa0nowadays, what’s known as\\xa0fast fashion\\xa0is cheap, not to mention\\xa0being environmentally unfriendly. Plus it’s cheaply made, which is the whole point:\\xa0Catwalk trends mass-produced for low prices and not meant to last. There are entire retail chains built on this premise.The result is that it can be far cheaper and far, far less time consuming to run to the mall and grab something off the rack for yourself or your child than it is to set up the sewing machine and do it yourself. Add up the hours spent knitting a scarf or crocheting a sweater, never mind the cost of materials, and homemade items have become the luxuries and store-bought ones the bargain. Most people I know don’t even mend anymore (and shame on us).That’s not to say that plenty of Americans still don’t make plenty of stuff. After all, Joann, known as Jo-Ann Fabrics back when home sewing was more in style, is reorganizing its finances, not closing its 800-plus stores nationwide. While sales are also down at\\xa0craft chain Michaels, it still operates almost 1,200 stores throughout the country. For its part, Hobby Lobby continues to operate 1,000 stores\\xa0despite controversies\\xa0and boycotts surrounding the chain.Personally, I crave this crafting connection to the past, even if I don’t have the time or the energy to pursue it on a regular basis. (I’m slightly embarrassed to admit it took me more than a year to notice that the Joann outlet close to my home had closed.) At the same time, I prefer a simpler sewing store. Run in to get thread, run out with just the right shade of blue. I don’t want to be bombarded by construction paper, unpainted picture frames, packages of glitter and glue guns.Sadly, but not surprisingly, sewing alone can’t sustain a national chain. Not enough of us seem to do it anymore, for fun or necessity. I know less than a handful of people who can do even simple alterations, much less who actually do them, although I also know a dozen cosplayers who regularly create professional-level costumes. Their skills, like their outfits, are other-worldly.My own mom never learned to sew like that, or really at all. Not certain why, but I suspect her mother was both too busy running the dry cleaners and wanted more for her daughters than to repair other people’s clothes. I’m guessing grandma also believed that real Americans bought ready-made things rather than making them.Fortunately, my dad’s dad taught him, and he taught me. When I inherited my great grandmother’s\\xa0Featherweight 221\\xa0from the 1930s, one of the early portable electrics that somehow still weighed a ton, he’s the one who showed me how to work the\\xa0treadle.\\xa0He also passed on the old wives’ tale that people should chew on thread whenever someone sews a garment (or button) on them in order to make clear to the angel of death that they are very much alive and these are not shrouds. And I do\\xa0it\\xa0to this day.He’d be so happy to see my daughter — his granddaughter — and some of her Gen Z friends putting down their phones and picking up knitting and crochet needles, if not needle and thread. Never mind learning from mom or dad or granddad. The newest generation has the greatest teacher of all time: YouTube, with\\xa0its tutorials\\xa0for anything and everything.They learn online, they shop for materials online, and they sell their homemade wares online.\\xa0It’s\\xa0a\\xa0good\\xa0thing,\\xa0however traditions get passed down, even if it’s not so great for business.', 'Former President Donald Trump is starting to struggle under the weight of multiple legal cases against him.Trump has so far managed to use his indictments and court appearances to fuel his campaign, railing against what he claims is an establishment out to get him. For all the free airtime that the legal challenges have provided, however, the overall costs are starting to add up — and the financial penalties might just end up being more damaging than the criminal charges.While Trump has a narrow lead over President Joe Biden in the polls, the efforts to hold Trump accountable in the eyes of the law, and the financial judgments and hefty legal fees that come with them, could potentially take a devastating toll on his campaign.The most important thing at the moment is money — and the problem for Trump is that as his legal expenses and obligations are piling up,\\xa0his fundraising efforts have been lagging. His leadership political action committee, Save America, spent nearly $5.6 million in legal fees in February alone.\\xa0And while the super PAC Maga Inc. has refunded nearly all of that money, that’s money that could have been used for Trump’s campaign. (In total, Maga Inc. has refunded more than $52 million to Save America.)It doesn’t help that there is a growing fundraising gap between Trump and Biden. Right now, President Biden’s campaign coffers are overflowing. According to recent Federal Election Commission filings, the president had $71 million in available cash in his principal campaign account at the end of February, compared to Trump’s campaign, which reported $33.5 million.In a campaign where a relatively small percentage of swing voters in a handful of states will likely determine the outcome, turnout and advertising buys will have an outsized impact. Biden’s financial strength has allowed his campaign to unleash a torrent of blistering ads in swing states, targeting core voters such as Latinos. Democrats have also demonstrated that their campaign infrastructure is strong, as was evident in the 2018 and 2022 midterm elections, as well as special elections in 2023 and 2024.Trump, meanwhile, is desperately playing catch-up and could run into additional problems with fundraising over time, as he tries to persuade donors to give him more. It’s likely that big-ticket supporters would rather back a campaign for the next president than fund a collective bailout.Then there is the whopping $355 million, not counting interest, that Trump has been ordered to pay in the New York civil fraud case. After getting an insurance company to underwrite the $91.6 million bond to appeal the $83 million judgement in the E Jean Carroll defamation case, Trump is struggling to come up with\\xa0another massive bond.\\xa0Sources told CNN that Trump is going into panic mode ahead of the March 25\\xa0deadline\\xa0before New York Attorney General Letitia James can start to collect on the judgment, and the potential threat to his real estate holdings and financial empire are serious. If there is one thing that really gets to Trump, it is any threat to his wealth. That threat is now front and center.None of this is to say Trump isn’t in a strong position less than eight months out from the election — he is. His takeover of the Republican National Committee is an important step that will help reinvigorate his fundraising operations. His ability to garner free television news coverage, in part because of the trials, should not be underestimated. And his ability to draw money from small donors from a loyal fan base remains formidable.Trump might also be looking at a windfall, given that investors approved a deal Friday to merge Trump Media with a blank-check company. The new entity, Trump Media & Technology Group, will trade on the stock market under the ticker DJT, with Trump’s shares worth more than $3 billion at current market prices.But there are still questions surrounding Trump’s ability to monetize his stake in the company, and when, with the $464 million bond due this coming Monday.The warning signs are there. If\\xa0Biden can capitalize on his opponent’s financial weaknesses, the road to the White House might seem more promising than the polls have suggested.', '“My children ruined my career,” Lily Allen\\xa0told the Radio Times podcast\\xa0last week. “I mean I love them and they complete me, but in terms of pop stardom, totally ruined it.”Her\\xa0disclosure\\xa0tripped the internet into a frenzy of agonized responses. Some said they’ve had the\\xa0opposite experience, while many agreed that unless something drastically changes, women are doomed to compromise\\xa0either as parents or professionals.I found Allen’s words weirdly comforting. I had nothing against her pop career, and I definitely don’t relish the disproportionate pressure placed on mothers, whether they work or not. I shared the communal wave of anger over the fact that male pop stars\\xa0(and actors and footballers — insert\\xa0any other profession here) never say these\\xa0things. They’re never even asked about it, because\\xa0men’s careers never seem to falter with the advent of parenthood.It was her willingness to express the frank truth, rather than parrot the accepted cookie-cutter lines about “learning to prioritize” or how you can “have it all,” if you put enough sweat in, that I found reassuring.Honesty about the sacrifices\\xa0often demanded\\xa0not just\\xa0by\\xa0parenthood, but\\xa0by\\xa0adulthood, especially for women, is a valuable commodity\\xa0—\\xa0\\xa0especially from the mouth of someone who, superficially, appears to have won life’s lottery.I was so impressed that, like most people, I almost missed what she said next. She added: “If we were actually more about community, and taking care of the community, then maybe you could have it all.”That’s the point, isn’t it. The assumption that women become mothers, and that we’re prepared to endure almost anything to make that happen,\\xa0may ring true for some\\xa0—\\xa0but treating it like a universal truth limits opportunities for everyone.As it stands,\\xa0too many of us approach\\xa0life\\xa0as\\xa0a zero-sum game with two outstanding goals: parenthood and professional success. The notion that pursuing either one or both of these is everyone’s best hope for contentment doesn’t just suffocate individuality, it hampers the creation of communities in which all of us, no matter our aspirations, can thrive.In elementary school, the question was never if I would have children, but when. Marriage, Disney\\xa0films\\xa0assured me, was on the cards from 16 onwards. But what about the second bit? My father, who was 29 when I was born, thought I should have kids young, so that I could enjoy a full life and career while I was still fresh and energetic “afterward.”Even then, the implicit timeline stressed me out. Should I look for a potential mate at university, where there would also be intense pressure to perform academically and limber up for the working world? If I had my first kid at 21, how many more years would I have to spend supervising it and its siblings (I would have multiple kids, of course) before I could set them loose in the wild?What if I married someone who expected never to lift a finger in the house, whether I was working or not? Based on my most immediate experience of straight married couples — which was pretty much the only adult relationship modeled to me — this was very likely.It would have been so useful, at this impressionable age, to have been exposed to more flexible notions of what was possible, and a more realistic understanding of how things might play out. As it was, the contrast between what I was told and what I could see was at best confusing, and at worst frightening.Soon-to-be divorced grown-ups wearing rictus grins reiterated the assertion that their wedding day was “the happiest of my life,” and harried mothers who never seemed to smile insisted that having kids was the “best thing I ever did.” Adulthood seemed a mass of rigid ideals tangled in contradictions, and I wanted no part of it.Thankfully, almost everything I was taught about relationships, parenting and careers as a child turned out to be nonsense, and following a roughly decade-long detox from those ideas, I was able to form a few of my own. Among those was the certainty that though I really, really love children, I don’t want to have any. I’m so glad I\\xa0recognized\\xa0this distinction between appreciation and need before making a human being who would\\xa0depend on me for a long time, and maybe forever.I have also learned that while careers can be very fulfilling, they are mostly useful for paying for more enjoyable things, like holidays and Pepsi Max. The happiest, proudest moments in my life have rarely had anything to do with work. What I’ve most often found to be true is that dreams of any kind come at a\\xa0cost\\xa0— and almost everyone, whatever they’re doing, is paying an invisible toll to pursue theirs.The assumption that we’re all so desperate to become parents that we’re prepared to trade off everything else that’s important to us doesn’t just leave mothers grossly unsupported, it treats parenthood like an exam we —\\xa0\\xa0women —\\xa0have to pass to become certified adults. If it wasn’t taken for granted that we’re all heading for the same narrow endgame, we might pay more attention to the many other important things that make life worth living — and help build a world in which everyone could be better looked after.“Having it all” means something different to everyone. But whether we’re parents or not, there’s still too much shame in admitting that our “all” looks different to the next person’s “all” — and that realizing our dearest expectations usually\\xa0means giving up something else that’s precious. Parents absolutely need and deserve more support. But so do the rest of us. The solution, as Allen said, can’t come from looking inward. For true individuality to thrive, we have to think, and act, together.', 'The already off-the-rails Princess of Wales controversy has veered off in an unexpected direction. In recent days, the debate has shifted from wild speculation over the princess’s whereabouts to a moral panic about the British royal family’s apparent history of doctoring photos presented to the public as candids.The photo-doctoring controversy has provided a pretext for more legitimate media outlets, including this one, to weigh in on the great Kate debate, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that it is just that — a pretext.So, Kate touches up her photos. Who doesn’t these days? The real underlying issue is whether it is legitimate for the royal family to assert a right to privacy and to keep crucial details about the princess’s health from the public.The palace’s view meanwhile is that family members should have some level of medical privacy despite their positions as public servants.But briefly, let us recap how we got here. Kate has not made an official public appearance since Christmas Day, shortly before entering hospital to undergo “planned abdominal surgery” — recovery from which would require her to abstain from public duties through Easter.After weeks of speculation about the princess’s health and whereabouts, on March 10 the palace released a purportedly candid photo of the princess and her three children, said to have been taken by Prince William, in honor of Mothering Sunday, the British equivalent of US Mother’s Day. But the candid photo, it turned out, wasn’t so candid after all.Shortly after, the key press agencies Reuters, Getty and the Associated Press pulled the photo from their systems and issued statements to the effect that it did not meet journalistic standards of truthful representation.The princess later apologized for the confusion around the photograph and confessed that occasionally she likes to “experiment with editing.”Then, on Tuesday, the international photo agency Getty announced that they had determined that a 2023 photograph of the late Queen Elizabeth II surrounded by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, taken by Kate, had been digitally enhanced at source.All of which has prompted extensive media debate about the history and legitimacy of royal image alteration, including a lengthy piece in Vogue, ironically a publication known for doctoring its own photographs.It is fair to say that Kate has history on her side. The royals’ long history of embellishment in portraiture even got a nod in the rock musical “Six,” in which Henry VIII’s fourth wife Anne of Cleves sings “Ich bin Anna of Cleves — when he saw my portrait he was like Ja! But I didn’t look as good as I did in my pic.” It’s a reference to the purportedly disingenuous 1530s Hans Holbein portrait that allegedly convinced Henry to propose to the German princess.Most people, whether or not they are royals, assume that portraits — even ostensibly candid portraits like the Mothering Sunday photograph — should present the best version of themselves, if not a better than best version.The ubiquity of photo editing on social media is why we have the hashtag #nofilter, used to brag that a picture was legitimately so impressive as not to need any kind of digital manipulation.But you needn’t look online to find examples. I will admit to having a doctored picture of my husband’s extended family atop my piano. My brother-in-law photoshopped together several iterations to get an image in which everyone was smiling with their eyes open. And tomorrow my son has his first-grade school picture — the school sent home an order form with an option to pay extra to have your child’s photo professionally retouched.So the pretended outrage around Kate’s embellished photos has a whiff of Capt. Renault in “Casablanca” claiming that he is “shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on” in Rick’s Café… before shamelessly pocketing his winnings.If most people are not at heart either surprised or particularly bothered to learn that official royal photographs are not unvarnished documentary evidence, then why has this story generated so much interest?The Daily Mail columnist Richard Kay argued last week that the real issue was one of trust: “Trust and integrity are precious commodities. The public adore the royals, but that adoration rests on being told the truth.” Leaving aside the question of whether the British public “adore” the royals, the British people do feel a certain entitlement over them, an entitlement that goes beyond the belief that they should not be deceived.In exchange for their state-supported privilege, most Britons feel entitled to a level of access to the royal family that is incompatible with Kate’s nearly three-month mystery seclusion.More than 150 years ago, the man who would be future prime minister, Lord Salisbury, made the same point when Queen Victoria temporarily withdrew from public life following the death of her husband Prince Albert. “Seclusion is one of the few luxuries in which royal personages may not indulge … loyalty needs a life of almost unintermitted publicity to sustain it.” Or, as the motto famously attributed to Queen Elizabeth II goes: “I have to be seen to be believed.”It’s a mantra that King Charles III appears to have taken to heart. In contrast to the princess, he allowed himself to be photographed leaving the London Clinic on January 29, after receiving treatment for an enlarged prostate, whereas Kate’s departure from the same hospital that same day went unrecorded.As head of state, he needs to be seen out and about. When it was clear his health condition would affect his abilities to perform his public-facing duties, the King was quick to inform the public that cancer had been detected during the prostate procedure and that he would be receiving treatment.While it is easy to understand the princess’s desire for privacy during what is doubtless a difficult time,the length of her time away feels incompatible with her position as a “working royal.”Kate still hasn’t been seen in public for any official engagements, but she was spotted at a farm shop near her home with husband Prince William on Saturday, easing some questions around her health.Like the King and Queen Camilla, the Prince and Princess of Wales and the other seven “working royals” are meant to serve the country publicly for which they are paid by British taxpayers from the sovereign grant, currently upwards of around £86 million ($109 million) a year. Public appearances are arguably their raison d’etre.The royal family, like everyone else, should be entitled to a period of paid sick leave. But just as most of us cannot disappear from work for months on end without sufficient explanation, some British people feel a legitimate right to ask the Windsors to be more forthcoming about Kate’s condition.', 'Editor’s note:\\xa0Peter Rutland is\\xa0professor\\xa0of government at Wesleyan University and an expert in the\\xa0politics of contemporary Russia.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View\\xa0more opinion\\xa0at CNN.Director Jonathan Glazer’s acclaimed movie “The Zone of Interest” recently won\\xa0two Oscars\\xa0— for best international feature film and for sound.\\xa0Steven Spielberg has declared\\xa0it to be the best Holocaust film since his own “Schindler’s List” came out in 1993.In\\xa0his\\xa0Oscar acceptance\\xa0speech, Glazer, who is himself Jewish, invoked the Holocaust to criticize Israel’s military actions in Gaza. His speech drew some\\xa0praise\\xa0but also\\xa0criticism\\xa0from the Jewish community — including from the movie’s executive producer,\\xa0Danny Cohen.But in some important respects, the film is even more troubling than Glazer’s speech.The film documents the mundane life of the family of Auschwitz commandant\\xa0Rudolf Höss (played by\\xa0Christian Friedel)\\xa0and his wife,\\xa0Hedwig (Sandra Hüller),\\xa0while the atrocities themselves are kept out of sight behind the\\xa0concentration\\xa0camp wall. It was\\xa0inspired\\xa0by the 2014 novel “The Zone of Interest” by Martin Amis, the\\xa0enfant terrible\\xa0of English letters whose works use satire as a vehicle for reveling in\\xa0money, sex and power.What the\\xa0satiric\\xa0movie “Saltburn”\\xa0does for the English upper class, “The Zone of Interest”\\xa0is doing for National Socialism.While the evil of Nazism is an abstraction\\xa0in the movie, out of sight and out of mind, viewers are invited to identify with the daily life of the family\\xa0Höss.\\xa0The lush images of the film convey an idyllic family life, with an immaculately clean house and bountiful garden. The Nazis loved their children and their pets. They played the piano.Glazer\\xa0has explained\\xa0that his goal was to show that the perpetrators of the Holocaust were not monsters but humans, just like us. It could have happened anywhere:\\xa0to\\xa0anyone,\\xa0by\\xa0anyone. Viewers are invited to consider that as we go about our mundane lives, evil is taking place somewhere behind a wall, which we chose not to look over.But\\xa0the whole idea of making\\xa0a Nazi pastoral\\xa0film is historically misleading and frankly offensive. As Israeli film critic\\xa0Avner Shavit\\xa0has pointed out, Glazer has managed to make a film about the Holocaust in which we never see any Jews.Likewise, in a 45-minute discussion of the film by the cast and crew at the\\xa0Cannes\\xa0Film Festival in May, the question of Jews never came up. Instead, producer James Wilson talked about how white racism and colonialism were driven by beliefs “that were very similar to the ideas that were propagated by National Socialism in the 1930s.” An audience member saw connections to the\\xa0“Don’t say gay” law\\xa0in Florida.But the Holocaust happened to the Jews, at the hands of the Nazis and their collaborators, and its specificity should not be diluted into a general meditation on the\\xa0banality of evil.The movie’s conceit\\xa0is not a\\xa0particularly clever\\xa0or original take on history. The fact that the guards had happy moments during their time at the camp was vividly revealed by the\\xa0photo album of deputy commander Karl-Friedrich Höcker that was donated to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2007.Glazer is echoing\\xa0elements\\xa0of the “banality of evil” argument laid out in Hannah Arendt’s “Eichmann in Jerusalem.” In his 1961 trial,\\xa0Adolf Eichmann’s defense\\xa0was that he was just a bureaucrat carrying out orders. But Arendt was wrong. Due to the release\\xa0of long-hidden tapes\\xa0that started to become\\xa0available in the 2010s\\xa0that the Nazi official made while in exile in Argentina, we now\\xa0know\\xa0that Eichman,\\xa0the chief logistics officer of the Holocaust,\\xa0was an ideological\\xa0zealot\\xa0deeply committed to National Socialism.For some time scholars have studied “banal nationalism”: the expression of national identity in everyday life. But there was nothing banal about the Holocaust.Indeed, the film implies that\\xa0Höss\\xa0was just doing his job.\\xa0But\\xa0Höss\\xa0was not just a bored bureaucrat and family man. He was\\xa0a fanatical Nazi\\xa0who had joined the party in 1922 and was sent to jail for participating in\\xa0a political assassination\\xa0the following year.“The Zone of Interest” is rather tedious as a film. It barely has a plot, and the conversations and daily routines are repetitious. Several scenes will leave viewers confused, such as the one where\\xa0Höss\\xa0finds\\xa0a jawbone\\xa0while fishing in the river and drags his kids out of the water. I would not have known what was happening except I had previously read in a review that there are supposedly human remains being dumped in the river.Likewise, the local girl\\xa0going out at night to leave food for the camp inmates (based on a true story) will have mystified most of the audience.\\xa0The scene will have pleased the Polish authorities\\xa0who helped to produce the film,\\xa0since it portrays the Poles as helping the Jews.\\xa0Yes, some Poles did heroically help Jews. But some joined in\\xa0pogroms, or betrayed Jews in hiding to the Germans. These grim facts have been documented by historian\\xa0Jan Gross, provoking\\xa0intense controversy in Poland. No sign of that in this film.There is a long history of fascination with the aesthetics of the Third Reich, as in the films of\\xa0Leni Riefenstahl. Back in 1975, Susan Sontag wrote a perceptive essay condemning the\\xa0fetishization\\xa0of Nazi paraphernalia. “The Zone of Interest” will certainly appeal to those who admire the aesthetics of Nazism: the striking uniforms, the distinctive “fashy” (short for fascist) haircuts, the nice animals. It will also appeal to people who like gardening.But viewers who want insights into the tragic history of the Holocaust should look elsewhere.', 'Donald Trump’s first criminal trial was supposed to begin Monday.Instead, his lawyers will get the chance to argue for a lengthy postponement and even a dismissal of the charges.Judge Juan Merchan is holding a pre-trial hearing in New York on Monday to discuss the discovery issues that led to the delay of the trial on charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney related to hush money payments until at least the middle of next month.Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business documents related to the repayment of Michael Cohen for hush-money payments made before the 2016 election to cover up an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.If the trial starts in April, it would be the first of Trump’s four criminal trials to begin – and potentially the only one that would occur before the November election.Here’s what to know:The trial was postponed and Monday’s hearing was ordered after more than 100,000 new documents were turned over by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, related to the 2018 prosecution of Trump’s former lawyer Cohen, who is a key witness in the case.Trump’s lawyers say the new information is potentially exculpatory for the former president and they need at least 90 days to properly review the new material – a delay that fits with the former president’s overall efforts to delay all four criminal trials he’s facing until after the November election.Merchan said the trial postponement would be 30 days from the date of his letter, March 15, meaning the earliest the trial could start is April 15.The judge made clear that the hearing would only focus on the document production from the Southern District of New York, and not other issues such as the complaint from Trump’s lawyers that a new documentary about Daniels was intended to be released close to the start of trial to prejudice the jury pool.The documents in question relate to the 2018 federal investigation into Cohen that led to charges on campaign finance violations and tax evasion.The bulk of the documents include records relied upon to obtain search warrants for Cohen’s devices and homes, including bank records. The US attorney’s office also turned over 30,000 pages related to documents seized from five iPhones and email accounts associated with Cohen.In addition, prosecutors said the US attorney’s office turned over FBI interview notes from special counsel Robert Mueller’s interviews with Cohen, which the office only received in December as a result of Freedom of Information Act litigation.In all, more than 200,000 pages of records this month were handed over.Trump’s attorneys and prosecutors are pointing fingers at one another over the reason the US attorney’s office did not turn over tens of thousands of documents until this month.Trump’s team alleged that the district attorney was trying to hide exculpatory evidence ahead of the trial, and that the US attorney’s office only turned it over following a January subpoena from Trump’s attorneys.But the district attorney says that Trump’s attorneys are to blame for the delay. Prosecutors argue that Trump’s attorneys raised no issues with the document production made in July 2023 until six months later with the January subpoena.“The belated nature of the recent productions is entirely a result of defendant’s own inexplicable and strategic delay in identifying perceived deficiencies in the People’s disclosures and pursuing independent means to obtain that evidence,” prosecutors wrote in a filing.The effort to dismiss the indictment is likely a long shot – Merchan has already rejected previous motions for dismissal.But the judge could signal on Monday whether he thinks the delay he put in place is long enough to go through the new documents – and whether he might block any testimony.Merchan, has already ruled that he would allow testimony from Cohen, rejecting a motion from Trump to prevent him from testifying because of credibility problems.\\xa0And, he said Daniels could testify finding that she is part of the timeline.A trial is expected to last six weeks, meaning Trump would be in the courtroom four days a week while it’s ongoing (the court will not meet on Wednesdays).', 'New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy is suspending her campaign for Bob Menendez’s Senate seat, she announced Sunday.“After many busy, invigorating, and yes, challenging months, I am suspending my Senate campaign today,” she said in a video posted on X. “I have been genuine and factual throughout, but it is clear to me that continuing in this race will involve waging a very divisive and negative campaign, which I am not willing to do.”“And with Donald Trump on the ballot and so much at stake for our nation, I will not in good conscience waste resources tearing down a fellow Democrat,” she added.Murphy’s decision comes just days before a judge was expected to rule on a lawsuit aimed at kneecapping local bigwigs’ influence over party primaries and the nominating process.Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, who’s vying for the Senate seat, had asked the court for a\\xa0preliminary injunction banishing the\\xa0so-called party line\\xa0– a ballot structure that allows county leaders to give preferential placement to their endorsed primary hopefuls – ahead of the June 4 primary.But the judge in the case was concerned, and the defendants had argued, that the time frame was too tight to make such a change. With Murphy dropping out, however, the urgency to address the primary ballot design is gone – meaning “the line” could be in place for the coming primary election.“We will continue our efforts to strengthen our democracy in New Jersey while we come together to stand up against the dangerous agenda pushed by Trump,” Kim said in a statement Sunday, suggesting the lawsuit would continue. The congressman praised Murphy as “a voice for progress and public service in our state,” adding, “I respect her decision to carry on that work as First Lady.”Advocates of changing the party-line system raised questions about Murphy’s decision.“This sudden change of heart on the part of Tammy Murphy, on the eve of the ruling of Judge (Zahid) Quraishi on the controversial New Jersey county line, seems more than suspicious,” Yael Niv, president of the Good Government Coalition of New Jersey, said in a text message.“The Good Government Coalition of New Jersey – and the whole grassroots community that has been fighting the line for years – wonder if this announcement is not a last ditch effort to save the county line. This just feels very Jersey. It seems like the party machine that was propping up the First Lady has asked her to take one for the team,” Niv added.Ezra Levin – the co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible, which has backed Kim – dismissed criticism that the congressman’s campaign is focused only on the ballot system. (Murphy said in her Sunday video, “Instead of talking about process and politics, my campaign has been about solutions for families and a vision for the next generation.”)“Andy Kim’s campaign wasn’t focused on ‘process.’ It was focused on democracy. Democracy matters to voters. Democrats across the country should take note,” Levin said. “Andy Kim is now on track to become a unique voice in the Senate.”Murphy, the\\xa0wife of two-term Gov. Phil Murphy,\\xa0entered the Democratic primary in November as a first-time candidate with previous associations with GOP politics. Her early endorsements in the primary, however, suggested she might get a plum spot on the ballot –\\xa0and a\\xa0potentially decisive advantage\\xa0over Kim.Under the party line system, party-backed candidates for a variety of offices appear in a single, prominent column on the ballot, whereas those who do not receive a place on “the line” are scattered across the ballot. Donald Trump’s election in 2016, and the resulting grassroots progressive activism, helped accelerate resistance to the party-line system, but it took off in a major way once the Murphy-Kim primary started brewing.Menendez, who is facing bribery and obstruction of justice charges,\\xa0announced Thursday\\xa0that he would not run for reelection in the Democratic primary but again left open the possibility of an independent bid this summer. The senator has forcefully denied the charges against him and has said that he will prove his innocence while claiming that he is being persecuted by prosecutors.This story and headline have been updated.', 'The end of the line could be near for New Jersey’s almighty political machine.A federal judge in Trenton is poised to rule as early as this week on a lawsuit aimed at kneecapping local bigwigs’ influence over party primaries and the nominating process. First lady Tammy Murphy’s suspension of her campaign on Sunday, however, has raised questions about the urgency of a decision ahead of the June 4 primary.Democratic Senate candidate Andy Kim is asking the court for a\\xa0preliminary injunction banishing the so-called party line – a ballot structure that allows county leaders to give preferential placement to their endorsed primary hopefuls. A ruling in the South Jersey congressman’s favor, though applicable only to the June primary, would – with the state’s off-year elections on the horizon – accelerate the unraveling of a system that has for decades allowed heavy-handed party bosses to dominate the makeup and character of New Jersey politics.The fight for transparency and election fairness in the Garden State goes back more than a century. After some significant early wins for reformers, the balance of power shifted back to the machine over the course of the 20th century. By the time Donald Trump, the tabloid-star-turned-politician, came along in 2015, the system appeared to be hardened in its favor.But Trump’s ascent to the presidency, even in a state that he lost by more than half a million votes\\xa0in 2016, triggered a grassroots revolt that eventually put the “party line” in the crosshairs of good government advocates. The “pro-democracy” agenda embraced by President Joe Biden and national Democrats after the January 6, 2021,\\xa0riot at the US Capitol brought the issue further into the mainstream. Kim’s lawsuit, nearly a carbon copy of one originally filed three years ago, had attracted national attention because of his primary against Murphy. The wife of two-term Gov. Phil Murphy ended her campaign Sunday, citing her unwillingness to “waste resources tearing down a fellow Democrat.”Kim, among others, is vying\\xa0to replace Sen. Bob Menendez, the longtime Democratic incumbent now facing a thick and colorful assortment of corruption charges that could land him in prison for years.\\xa0Menendez\\xa0announced Thursday that he would not run for reelection in the Democratic primary but again left open the possibility of an independent bid this summer.Murphy’s\\xa0entrance in the primary in November,\\xa0about two months after Kim, was greeted with a flood of endorsements, several of which either guaranteed or strongly suggested she would be given a plum spot on the primary ballot –\\xa0and a\\xa0potentially decisive advantage\\xa0over Kim\\xa0before the campaign had begun in earnest.Murphy’s decision to seek the seat, and the speed with which local pooh-bahs lined up behind her, triggered what could be a generational realignment in a state\\xa0historically\\xa0dominated by powerful party bosses in the way that many Americans associate with a bygone era – recalling New York’s Tammany Hall of the mid-19th century.Those structures largely came apart\\xa0elsewhere\\xa0over the\\xa0past few decades, but New Jersey Democratic leaders have retained their\\xa0unique influence\\xa0thanks in large part to “the line,” a shorthand\\xa0for\\xa0the prized ballot real estate controlled by\\xa0county party officials, many of whom are themselves unelected.The practice places the names of party-backed candidates for a variety of offices in a single, prominent column. Those who do not receive a place on “the line” are scattered across the ballot, marooned in what is often referred to as “Ballot Siberia.”\\xa0Reform advocates and\\xa0progressive Democratic groups operating outside the good graces of entrenched leadership have long railed against the practice, calling it anti-democratic and tantamount to voter suppression.For decades, though, “the line” existed without a serious challenge. The risks for dissenters was too high and, by its nature, the process successfully froze out critics who might want to run for office and seek change from within. The broader chilling effect largely zeroed out criticism even among minor players.But\\xa0the explosion of grassroots liberal engagement following Trump’s election –\\xa0a shock to the system that ignited a wave of new interest that echoed the post-Watergate push for good government laws – emboldened “line” opponents.Frustrated, anxious and angry, the Democratic grassroots across the country revolted at every level of government, mixing intense lobbying of federal lawmakers with a surge in\\xa0outsider\\xa0candidacies for down-ballot offices. Groups such as Indivisible, with its hyper-engaged local chapters – many stocked with middle-aged, upper-middle-class,\\xa0first-time\\xa0political activists – began to question everything from party strategy to the arcane institutional processes that\\xa0had operated for so long with a minimum of oversight.“The fight against the county line and the political machines really goes back to the election of Trump, when it picked up serious speed,” said Rutgers professor Julia Sass Rubin, who testified in Kim’s lawsuit and has conducted extensive research on the line’s outsize influence. “There were a number of grassroots organizations that formed, we saw this nationally, especially started by women.”But Rubin said it was not until Murphy announced her Senate run, and immediately received broad backing from New Jersey Democratic leaders, that the issue exploded.“The Tammy Murphy-Andy Kim race\\xa0has put (the issue) on steroids. It has really amplified general public awareness, which was building. But it was building among the aware, kind of progressive grassroots,” Rubin said. “This brought it into the mainstream in a big way.”Following Trump’s election, rank-and-file liberals in New Jersey – like many other largely Democratic states – rushed to enmesh themselves in local politics. But their ambitions were mostly thwarted.\\xa0Though New Jersey Democrats picked up US House seats in the 2018 midterms, the state seemed immune\\xa0to\\xa0an explosion of political insurgencies, typified not only by the rise of “The Squad” but also the ascent of younger female and minority candidates who sought to wrest power from what they viewed as an indifferent, self-serving establishment.“The (Democratic newcomers) thought they were on the right team here and thought because they were Democrats, they had the ability to stand up and say proudly that they’re the party for democracy, especially in light of Trump being president,” said longtime progressive activist Sue Altman, a Democratic candidate for the state’s 7th Congressional District. But that initial optimism was blunted when “they found out that at the local level or the city level or the county level or the state legislative level, that their own beloved Democrats were not practicing ‘little d’ democracy,” Altman said.The complications facing would-be reformers in New Jersey were initially underscored by the state party’s lack of political turmoil.\\xa0Though hardly a machine choice,\\xa0wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive and Democratic National Committee finance chair\\xa0Phil Murphy won the governor’s office in 2017.Over the next few years, as\\xa0political insurgents like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, across the river in New York, and Cori\\xa0Bush in Missouri\\xa0unseated longtime Democratic incumbents\\xa0in races up and down the ballot, progressive groups largely bypassed New Jersey. The state’s expensive media market\\xa0and the bureaucratic barriers facing outsider campaigns\\xa0made it an\\xa0unwise place to spend precious resources.“It is extremely difficult to engage in any kind of competitive primaries in New Jersey because at the end of the day, the winners are likely going to be chosen by the establishment,” said Ezra Levin, the co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible.Indivisible does not, like more confrontational groups including Justice Democrats, typically get involved in fraught primary fights. Their membership, Levin said, is engaged on multiple policy fronts, from health care to immigration, “but the very top issue that they care about is democracy itself – this feeling that it was under threat and this sense that the Democratic Party when Trump got elected was not equipped to take on that threat.”Levin said that for Indivisible groups, the battle in New Jersey over “the line” has not been about a preference between Kim or Murphy, though the organization endorsed Kim.“When I’m talking to our advocates, I will always say that the enemy isn’t MAGA, the enemy is cynicism and nihilism and fatalism,” Levin said. “Corrupt systems like the ‘county line’ in New Jersey (is) an enemy because that dissuades folks from actually getting involved. And if folks don’t get involved, then we’ll lose.”As the Murphy-Kim race heated up, interest in ending – or, among party leaders, defending – “the line” has also increased in size and intensity. A 2021 lawsuit, brought by and supported by a coalition of progressive Democrats, including Altman and the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, has been\\xa0wending\\xa0its way through the court system\\xa0for years.But for Kim, there was no time to waste. He effectively took up the old litigation late last month, using the same lawyers, in a bid to redesign the ballots before the June 4 primary. His request of the court, simply put, is for a federal judge to order that New Jersey follow all other states and group together candidates for any given office.On Monday, Kim testified in\\xa0US District Judge Zahid Quraishi’s courtroom that he believed the current process “to be averse to the pursuit of democracy.”“I’m not asking for any advantage for me,” Kim told the court. “All I’m asking for is for New Jersey to be in line with 49 other states in terms of pursuing an office block-style ballot that would allow us to have a fairer system here.”Though Kim has also won some county lines in this primary, and appeared on them during his own past races, the third-term congressman argued that a fundamentally unjust institution compelled him to play ball.“Despite my personal concerns about how this went,” Kim said, “I felt I had no choice but to participate in the system.”The Murphy campaign, speaking before the candidate dropped out, took a dimmer view of Kim’s motivations.“Unfortunately, Congressman Kim’s focus has been on personal attacks and process,” said Murphy spokesperson Alexandra Altman, who has previously dismissed the lawsuit as a “hypocritical stunt.”Kim campaign spokesperson Katey Sabo disputed that characterization, calling the line’s potential undoing “a critical issue in protecting our democracy.”The arguments against redrawing the ballots, at least in this case and the current discourse, are less high-minded, with the defendants in the suit – clerks from the 19 counties with county line ballots – contending that the changes sought by the plaintiff, Kim, would be too difficult to implement this late in the campaign-election calendar. (Ballots are printed and mailed out well before the June 4 primary date.)A ruling is expected in the coming days or weeks. Tammy Murphy, who is not involved in the case, had said she would follow the rules, regardless of the outcome.\\xa0Altman, her spokesperson, told CNN that Kim’s strategy “does not help the real New Jerseyans struggling to make ends meet or protect their reproductive rights from being stripped away.”No matter how the judge decides in Kim’s last-ditch bid, “the line” appears to be on borrowed time.Ahead of the hearing last week, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin announced in a letter to the court that he would not defend the “challenged statutes,” calling them “unconstitutional.” He will also drop out of the 2021 case, which remains in the judicial pipeline, after initially defending “the line.”The governor, under whom Platkin served as general counsel before being appointed to his current post, publicly disagreed with his longtime political ally, saying a defense of the system “would have been appropriate and consistent with the actions” of Platkin’s predecessors.“Outside the context of any campaign, Governor Murphy has consistently and accurately noted that the bracketing of candidates is permitted by duly enacted laws that have been on the books for decades,” Murphy spokesman Mahen Gunaratna told CNN. “It is well-established that Attorneys General have a general obligation to defend the constitutionality of statutes, regardless of their own personal views.”That dust-up followed a weekend in which Kim had secured the backing of Democrats in Morris and Atlantic counties – where the process isn’t as tightly controlled by party leadership. In Camden County, where the local boss keeps a tighter grip, video of another Senate candidate, progressive Patricia Campos-Medina, being blocked from entering the county Democratic convention went viral.Around the time Platkin’s memo went out, the Hoboken Democrats – who operate under the powerful Hudson County Democratic Organization, whose leader backed Tammy Murphy immediately upon her entering the race – announced that their own process had yielded a landslide victory for Kim. Moments later, Hoboken Democratic Committee Chair Rachel Hodes announced her resignation, alleging harassment by Murphy allies and a “gross rejection of democracy” by the county group.“Since we announced this (endorsement) meeting, I began receiving calls and emails denigrating and diminishing the integrity of our process,” Hodes wrote. “Multiple senior advisors on the Tammy Murphy campaign called me to coerce me into changing our process, essentially calling it a sham.”Both sides have acknowledged that a key sticking point was the Hoboken Democrats’ decision to solicit written statements from the candidates rather than inviting them to deliver their message in person. (Candidates were allowed to make more direct appeals to Hoboken committee voters.)The train kept rolling on Monday morning when, shortly before the federal court hearing began, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, who is running to succeed Phil Murphy as governor in 2025, switched sides in the Senate primary and backed Kim.“It’s no secret I’ve been disappointed with the (Tammy Murphy) campaign and how it has been conducted,” Fulop said in a statement, which also suggested the first lady consider bowing out of the race. “I’ve expressed that over the last two months repeatedly both privately and publicly, and at this point, it’s clear to me that I was wrong with my early support and endorsement of Tammy Murphy for Senate.”The growing backlash among ambitious officials underscored the rapidly changing tides of public opinion – and awareness. On Wednesday, in another sign of concern among brass from both parties (New Jersey Republicans also employ “the line” in their primaries), state Senate and Assembly leaders announced they would\\xa0begin “a public process on ballot design in New Jersey, including a thorough and thoughtful review of other states, as well as a process that involves input from the public.”But their statement also echoed other supporters of “the line,” insisting that the legislature – and not the courts – keep “the authority to determine the law regarding ballot design and the appropriate discretion used by county clerks.”“We are prepared to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure public trust in a transparent and democratic process in New Jersey,” the leadership quartet said.For many Democrats in the Garden State, however, their words landed with a thud. How the court views the pledge, and whether it is taken into consideration, remains to be seen.This story has been updated on Sunday to reflect Tammy Murphy’s suspension of her campaign.', 'House Democrats may save Mike Johnson’s speakership – but he first must outline a pathway to approving aid to Ukraine, multiple Democratic sources told CNN.If Johnson were to announce\\xa0he would take up the Senate’s $95 billion aid package, Democrats would vote in droves to keep him in the position, sources said.Yet Johnson has already signaled an openness to a separate bipartisan plan emerging in the House, and he’d\\xa0already told GOP lawmakers\\xa0that he may schedule floor time on that plan when lawmakers return from their Easter recess.But that bipartisan plan has generated little Democratic enthusiasm, in large part because of its new border security restrictions, including reinstating the so-called “Remain in Mexico” policy. Plus, Johnson has signaled a willingness to turn the Ukraine aid into a loan for the country, an idea floated by former President Donald Trump that has prompted Democratic skepticism.If Johnson tries to move on the House plan, Democrats may opt to save him but in smaller numbers, one Democratic source said.While the exact timing remains unclear, the first procedural vote to oust Johnson is expected to take the form of a “motion to table” – or kill – fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resolution to vacate the speakership. Democrats are weighing whether to kill the resolution on the first procedural vote, but say they need to hear the\\xa0speaker publicly outline his intentions on Ukraine aid.“If he does the responsible thing, which is allowing members of Congress to vote on a bill that will pass and that is in our national security interests, and subsequent to that a non-serious actor\\xa0that doesn’t want to govern brings a motion to vacate, yes I would motion to table in that circumstance,” Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, told CNN.In a meeting Friday before Greene announced her intention to force a vote seeking Johnson’s ouster, the speaker already was telling Republicans he was ready to move on an aid package for Ukraine when they return. But it’s unclear what form that package will take.“He said that’s going to come to the floor when we come back,” Rep. Greg Pence, an Indiana Republican, told CNN after meeting with Johnson on Friday morning. “And I think that’s good.”Several House Republicans have also warned that Greene’s move to oust Johnson could cost them the House in November, though some hardliners are weighing whether they would ultimately vote to remove him.Greene, for her part, indicated Sunday that she may not even force a vote this Congress.“I filed this motion to vacate but I haven’t called it,” she said on Fox News. “(I’m) giving our conference notice saying that we have got to find a new speaker. This may take weeks, it may take months, it may not even happen until next Congress. But\\xa0Speaker Johnson cannot remain as Speaker of the House.”Greene did not call up her resolution before the House left for a two-week recess on Friday, which means the two-legislative-day clock to force a vote has not yet started. It is ultimately up to Greene when and whether she forces a vote.Pence said the chaos in the House is “turning people off” politics.“You know, when I go home, people are telling me they’re not following what’s going on here anymore because they are tired of it. And when I mentioned that on the floor this week, talking to my peers, they’re hearing the same thing,” he said. “These games, not working together, it’s turning people off. And we want people to be engaged in politics and we’re working the wrong way.”Pressed on whether it could cost them the majority, Pence replied, “Oh, it surely could. It’s possible, right? It’s not helpful.”House Homeland Security Chair Mark Green, meanwhile, told CNN, “I’m disappointed. … I think it’s a distraction. We need to just – unfortunately this bill passed, and we’ve got a lot of other stuff now to do, some articles to walk over… we don’t need anything that’s going to disrupt that.”He said he hoped Greene will ultimately decide not to call up her resolution for a vote. “I don’t think we’ll let that happen this time. I mean, we’ll see how it goes, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.”But Rep. Richard Hudson, the chair of the House Republican campaign arm, downplayed the damage another speaker’s fight could cause in an election year. “I just don’t think people out there in the real world, outside of this bubble we’re standing in right now, care as much about who the speaker of the House is as they do about how expensive it is to buy the things they need for their family,” he said. “We are going to grow this House majority despite things that go on the House floor day to day.”He argued that “Speaker Johnson is going to remain speaker” despite the threat to oust him. “The House has to have a speaker to function. So, we need a speaker and I think Speaker Johnson has been an outstanding speaker and I stand behind him. I think we’ll get through this,” he added.Some hardliners are weighing whether they will vote to oust Johnson once it is brought up. “I’m open to that conversation,” said Rep. Eli Crane, one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall.Rep. Chip Roy on Sunday appeared reluctant to support Greene’s motion to vacate.\\xa0But Roy did say\\xa0“Mike was wrong” for not allotting members a full 72 hours to consider the funding package.“I opposed the use of the motion to vacate against Kevin McCarthy, very openly and very loudly against my right-flank colleagues and everybody across the entire body,” the Texas Republican told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”But Roy declined to directly say whether he would support his former House Freedom Caucus colleague’s motion, instead slamming the media for focusing on “inside-the-Beltway palace drama.”Rep. Ralph Norman indicated that he was still considering it as well. “We’ll see what happens. Look, I take this minute by minute,” he said. Pressed on whether he was comfortable overthrowing their leadership at this point, Norman replied, “I’m not saying that. Let’s see how we come out on this bill. Let’s see what he does, and we’ll go from there.”He added, “Anything’s possible.”McCarthy on Sunday urged Johnson to “not be fearful” of a potential vote to oust him from the speakership. “I do not think they could do it again,” McCarthy said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”“I don’t think the Democrats will go along with it too,” McCarthy added. “Focus on the country. Focus on the job you’re supposed to do, and actually do it fearlessly. Just move forward.”CNN’s Sam Fossum, Morgan Rimmer and Avery Lotz contributed to this report.', 'Former Republican\\xa0National\\xa0Committee\\xa0chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on Sunday called the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol “unacceptable” after years of deflecting on the issue.McDaniel, who is joining NBC News as a political analyst after exiting the RNC earlier this month, told the outlet that the Capitol riot “doesn’t represent our country. It certainly does not represent my party.”“We should not be attacking the Capitol; we should not be having violence,” she added. Asked why she didn’t offer such condemnation as RNC chairwoman, McDaniel responded, “When you’re the RNC chair, you kind of take one for the whole team.\\xa0Right now,\\xa0I get to be a little bit more myself.”McDaniel’s RNC exit comes amid a period of rising tensions between Donald Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, and the RNC. Trump and his team had been disappointed with the RNC’s finances, with the committee experiencing one of its most anemic years of fundraising in the last decade.The former president also believed that the RNC under McDaniel’s leadership should have done more to fight for his candidacy in the 2020 election, including retaining better lawyers to push the former president’s false claims of rampant voter fraud.Trump, McDaniel said Sunday, “absolutely wanted me to move aside and wanted Michael Whatley and Lara Trump to come in.”McDaniel said that while her role required her to remain neutral regarding GOP candidates, tensions rose with the Trump campaign when the former president decided to forgo this cycle’s primary debates.“We had debates, and there was tension and a little friction that started during that process. It was well played out in the media,”\\xa0McDaniel said. “And I knew at that point, when I was doing that role, and we were going to have debates, that when the nominee came forward, and it was likely to be\\xa0President Trump, that they were going to switch and that’s his right as nominee.”News of McDaniel’s hiring at NBC has drawn sharp backlash. She has a long history of assailing the news media as “fake” and her promotion of false claims around the 2020 elections.As RNC chair, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\\xa0told the officials, regarding the certification: “Do not sign it. … We will get you attorneys.”The Michigan Department of State’s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had “no merit.”\\xa0The state’s “elections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,” it said in a\\xa0detailed fact check\\xa0posted online.McDaniel acknowledged Sunday that Biden won the 2020 election “fair and square” even as she voiced concern over “issues” with the vote. “I believe that both can be true,” she said.Asked about the criticism of her RNC tenure, and the blame some have placed on her for a slate of Republican losses, McDaniel said, “I push back on that very hard.”“Under my time as chair, we’ve had more women in Congress ever than in the history of our party … we’ve had more minority growth in our party, and that didn’t just happen.”CNN’s Oliver Darcy, Kaitlan Collins,\\xa0Daniel Strauss, Michelle Shen\\xa0and Avery Lotz contributed to this report.', 'With its striking coloration, the giant panda\\xa0is an instantly recognizable species.A handful of giant pandas that aren’t black-and-white, however, do exist. These majestic creatures with brown-and-white fur inhabit a single mountain range in China. And now, scientists may have unraveled the mystery of the extremely rare pandas’ unusual coats, according to new research.The work, which involved studying the genetics of multiple pandas in the wild and in captivity, has suggested that pandas with brown-and-white coats\\xa0are the result of natural variation, rather than a sign of inbreeding in a dwindling population.The first brown panda known to science was a female named Dandan. A local ranger found the ailing bear in Foping County in Shaanxi province’s Qinling Mountains in March 1985. The panda was held in captivity until her death in 2000.Since Dandan’s discovery decades ago, there have been 11 reported sightings documented through official news sources or personal accounts shared with the authors of this latest study that appeared in the journal PNAS on March 4.“The recurring instances of brown pandas imply that this trait may be inheritable. However, to date, the genetic basis underlying the brown-and-white coat color remains unclear,” the authors wrote.Gaining a better understanding of the distinctive coloration could help inform efforts to breed brown-and-white pandas in captivity, said senior author Dr. Fuwen Wei, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation biology\\xa0at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Zoology in Beijing. The status of the giant panda as a species is vulnerable, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.To understand what lies behind the trait, the researchers studied Qizai, a male brown panda rescued as a cub in 2009 from Foping National Nature Reserve in Hanzhong. He is currently the only brown panda in captivity.When compared under a microscope with hair samples from three black-and-white pandas, Qizai’s brownish fur had fewer and smaller melanosomes, tiny structures found in cells that are responsible for skin and hair pigment in mammals. What’s more, the melanosomes were more likely to be irregularly shaped, the study team found.The researchers then gathered genetic information about Qizai and pieced together his family tree. Fresh scat, or bear poop, gathered at the nature reserve revealed the identity of his wild mother, a black-and-white female panda that wears a tracking collar and is known as Niuniu.The researchers also identified Qizai’s son, a black-and-white panda born in captivity in 2020. (The study team later identified Qizai’s father, Xiyue, a wild but tracked black-and-white panda, by studying the genetics of a wider population of pandas.)The scientists studied the genetic information from Qizai’s family members and compared it with the genetic information from 12 black-and-white pandas from the Qinling Mountains and 17 black-and-white pandas from other regions in China using information taken from scat and blood samples.While none of Qizai’s immediate family members had brown fur, the researchers were able to show that his parents and son all had one copy of the recessive trait on a gene known as Bace2, while Qizai had two copies.An individual’s genes can carry recessive traits, such as blue eyes or red hair in humans, without appearing as a physical characteristic. Each parent must possess a copy of the genetic variant and pass it on in order for the trait to appear in the offspring, as is the case with Qizai.Thanks to an analysis of a tissue sample stored for more than two decades in ethanol, the scientists also were able to sequence the genome of Dandan, the first known brown panda. Dandan had the same recessive trait, the researchers found.The scientists then conducted a wider analysis of 192 black-and-white giant pandas to verify the responsible gene as Bace2. The mutation causing the brown coats was only present in two pandas hailing from the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, not Sichuan province, where the majority of China’s giant pandas live.To confirm the findings, the scientists used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool to delete the genetic sequence they had identified as causing the mutation in the Bace2 gene in 78 lab mice. The change reduced the number and size of melanosomes in the mice.“The coat color of knockout mice is light brown,” said Wei, who is also president at Jiangxi Agricultural University\\xa0in Nanchang in China’s Jiangxi province.“It proves that this deletion has the potential to alter the coat color of a mouse, as the pigmentation pathway is relatively conserved (shared) among mammals. Therefore, it is very likely that this mutation influences the coat color of a brown panda.”It’s not clear what caused the genetic mutation. Wei said it must be linked to the specific environment of the Qinling Mountains, which has a different climate than Sichuan.  The genetic mutation did not appear to be a result of inbreeding, as once suspected, he said.“It is more likely to be a result of natural variation rather than inbreeding. Our kinship analysis indicates that Qizai’s parents are not closely related,” Wei added.Tiejun Wang, an associate professor in the department of natural resources at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, said it was good news that the unique coloration did not appear to be the result of inbreeding. Wang, who has studied brown pandas, was not involved in the study.“For those who are concerned about this species, this is a positive development,” said Wang, who said he worked as a field ranger in the mountains for 10 years.Wang said he applauded the team “for their tremendous efforts in trying to shed light on this scientific question.”', 'My love affair with small appliances started at an early age.The Easy-Bake Oven was my first glimpse of what magic could come from a miniature box, leading to a few experiments with microwave cooking — think nachos and Rice Krispie Treat bowls—during my latchkey kid years. And the minute I got my own off-campus apartment in college, I invested in my very own toaster oven.Twenty-something years later, toaster oven technology has moved far beyond the analog dial and hot coils of my first model. But my small oven love remains strong, and it’s the most-used appliance in my daily life.The word “oven” is crucial in its name because it does everything my full-size conventional oven can do and more. In fact, it’s not just a toaster oven; it’s a countertop oven.If I had to choose to keep only one of my kitchen toys — the high-speed blender, the stand mixer, the compressor ice-cream maker, the multicooker\\xa0— the countertop oven would likely come out on top. (OK, I admit it would be difficult to give up the stand mixer.) That’s how deep my commitment to my countertop oven reaches. Here’s why.Instead of having multiple appliances crowding my countertop, the countertop oven does the work of many. It toasts bread and bagels, sure, but it also has the capability to do convection baking, air frying, dehydrating and dough proofing.Its broiler is spacious enough and functions so much more effectively than my oven’s broiler that I don’t even risk throwing out my back to shove sheet pans into the drawer underneath the full-size oven. (Who designed these bottom broiler drawers, anyway?)My countertop oven is also my secret weapon in the fight for better leftovers. When I create a monthly meal plan, I’m always planning to reheat half of what I’m cooking, so this is a crucial function. And because most dishes taste better when they’re not zapped in a microwave, I let my countertop oven restore my meals to their original crispy, bubbly texture. No more soggy cutlets or mushy pasta casseroles in this house!Yes, I understand that a countertop oven will never heat food as quickly as the one-minute express cook button on a microwave can. But I’ll argue that the taste trade-offs are worth it, and that you’ll still be heating food and cooking more quickly than you would in a large conventional oven.My countertop oven preheats to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius) in five minutes (I’ve timed it), whereas my full-size oven takes 15 minutes to reach the same temperature. That’s a big difference — I can be done eating my leftover-but-perfectly-heated pizza in those 10 minutes!Moreover, the convection and air-fry functions on my countertop oven cook food more quickly and efficiently than conventional heat, since the convection method circulates hot air around the food for a more even heat distribution. I can shave at least five minutes off my baking and roasting times every time I make meals in my countertop oven.When the decades-old range in our kitchen finally went to the big scrap pile in the sky a few years ago, I refused to replace it with a high-end model. My top-of-the-line countertop oven cost half as much as the range we purchased, and I use it twice as often.I’ll never forget the process of testing my first cookbook, “Classic Snacks Made from Scratch,” during a sweltering New Jersey summer. It was July, and I was working on various recipes for homemade crackers, which meant keeping my oven on for hours — in a house without central air-conditioning.In between batches, I laid on my kitchen floor, sweating and crying, wondering why I was voluntarily putting myself through such torture.I still don’t have central air, but thankfully, I’m not regularly tasked with developing and testing multiple baked goods every day of the week. For everyday summer baking and roasting, however, I’ll use my countertop oven, which gives off much less heat than my full-size oven and cools down much more quickly once its cooking cycle is finished.If I want to bake some goodies that require my larger baking sheets or multiple sheet pans, I’ll simply bake on my grill.So, I’ve convinced you to ditch all your other appliances and replace them with a countertop oven. Great! But before you rush out to buy one, think about what oven best suits your cooking habits.Choose a model that can fit your everyday cookware and bakeware. My countertop oven is deep and wide enough to fit a standard 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) casserole dish or sheet pan or a 10-inch (25-centimeter) round baking pan or cast-iron skillet. This means I can cook meals for up to six or eight people in one little appliance.Size does matter. Yes, choosing a smaller oven can be tempting when it comes to keeping your kitchen looking open and tidy. For the most versatility, however, I’d recommend going with the largest model that can comfortably fit the space you’re planning to use it in. Your foods need the air circulating around them in the oven to cook most efficiently, so having a space that’s too small to allow that won’t be doing you any favors.Consider what extra functions you’ll need. As I noted earlier, my countertop oven comes with a lot of bells and whistles — including a few functions I don’t even bother using. I’ve never tried the slow cook function, for instance, even though it’s there. Some models come with wi-fi functionality so you can control them via an app. Decide if these things are worth the money to you.Casey Barber is a food writer, artist and editor of the website Good Food Stories.', 'Paleontologists with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History have discovered a previously unknown prehistoric species — a 270 million-year-old amphibian with wide eyes and a cartoonish grin — and its name is a nod to an iconic froggy celebrity.Kermit the Frog meet Kermitops gratus,\\xa0the most recent ancient amphibian to be identified after examination of a tiny fossilized skull that once sat unstudied in the Smithsonian fossil collection for 40 years, according to a paper published Thursday in the\\xa0Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.Predating the dinosaurs, Kermitops is believed to have roamed the lower Clear Fork Formation of Texas during the Early Permian Epoch\\xa0298.9 million to 272.3\\xa0million years ago. The skull of the ancient amphibian, measuring just over an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) long, features big oval eye sockets and — due to its slightly crushed state — a lopsided smile that researchers said reminded them of the Muppet icon.The discovery of the new amphibian species could provide some answers to how frogs and salamanders evolved to get their special characteristics today, the authors wrote in the paper.“One thing that Kermitops really shows is that the origins of modern amphibians are a little more complex than some of the research has led on,” said study coauthor Arjan Mann, a postdoctoral paleontologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.“And that really means that people need to keep studying these things because just looking at museum collections, like this fossil, has the potential to change our ideas of evolutionary hypotheses of living lineages.”The fossil was first uncovered in 1984 by the late Nicholas Hotton III, a museum paleontologist who had excavated fossils from the Red Beds in Texas, an area known to be rich in Permian-age remains.Researchers unearthed a large cache at the site, including the remains of ancient reptiles, amphibians and synapsids, the precursors to mammals. The resulting collection included so many finds, paleontologists could not study a number of the specimens, including the newly named Kermitops. That changed in 2021, when the skull caught the eye of Mann, a postdoctoral fellow at the time, who was sifting through the Texas collection to see whether any notable specimens had been overlooked.“Not only was (the skull) well-prepared by somebody, but it had features that distinguished it from anything else in the group that I’d ever seen,” Mann said. In early 2023, Calvin So, lead author of the new paper and a doctoral student at George Washington University, began to study the skull for a doctoral paper.Kermitops is not classified as a frog because the prehistoric amphibian does not share all the same traits and anatomy found in modern frogs, So said. But the researchers determined the specimen is from the group temnospondyls, which are believed to be the most common ancestor of all\\xa0lissamphibians\\xa0— a category that includes frogs, salamanders and caecilians,\\xa0Mann added.The researchers noted several features that the ancient amphibian shares with its modern-day relatives, including a similar location for the eardrum at the back of the skull, a small opening between the nostrils that produces a sticky mucus to help frogs catch their prey, and even evidence of bicuspid,\\xa0pedicellate teeth\\xa0that are unique to amphibians and are found in\\xa0most modern amphibian species.The presence of teeth and other modern features of this prehistoric species can help researchers to better understand the evolutionary transition amphibians went through to get their unique features, such as teeth, today.\\xa0A\\xa0June 2021 study\\xa0found that some species of frogs have lost and again evolved teeth several times throughout their lineages.“This work is significant because it provides yet one more distinct early distant relative of our modern amphibians,” said David Blackburn, a coauthor of that 2021 study and a curator of amphibians and reptiles at the Florida Museum of\\xa0Natural History at the University of Florida, via email.“The last 20 to 30 years has seen many new species discovered and described of these distant relatives, and each discovery tends to reshape our knowledge of the evolutionary tree,” Blackburn added.But Kermitops had many features distinct from its modern relatives. The critter’s robust skull had additional bones and elements that have likely disappeared with evolution, and its elongated snout paired with a short region of the skull behind the eyes was unique to the species, most likely serving to aid in catching insects.The fossil’s features, a mix of modern and prehistoric traits, reinforces previous suggestions that amphibians’ evolution was complex, said Marc Jones, a curator of fossil reptiles at the Natural History Museum London.“It further adds to the diversity of Early Permian animals that are likely the evolutionary cousins of modern amphibians. It highlights the need for more fossils from the Late Permian,” Jones said via email, adding he appreciated the amphibian’s name. “It’s not a frog but then technically neither is Kermit. He has five fingers and a lizard frill.”The early fossil record for lissamphibians is considered to be fragmentary, according to a news release from the\\xa0Smithsonian Institution,\\xa0and is largely due to the creatures’ small size and delicate bone composition, which make the fossils difficult to preserve and find later, So said.“What we see today is but a small percentage of all the things that were living in Earth’s history,” So added. “And one of the conditions that significantly improves fossil preservation is their size, because if it’s larger, it’s going to be more resistant to some of the erosional forces that we experience such as wind erosion and water erosion.”What’s more, while prehistoric species are typically thought to be large, Kermitops could help to fill in the gap of amphibian evolution, explaining how some of today’s critters got their small size.The skull of Kermitops\\xa0is of similar size to the skull of another well-known Early Permian\\xa0amphibian, Gerobatrachus, which had a head about an inch in length (2.5 centimeters). But many frogs today have bodies shorter than that length, Blackburn said.“You might wonder, ‘Were there really no very tiny vertebrates in the past, similar in size to miniature species today?’ My bet is that yes, they existed, but our ability to find them in the fossil record is very difficult,” Blackburn added.So said they hoped the species’ name would draw attention to the notable discoveries that paleontologists make through studying museum collections of prehistoric fossils — including those less imposing than dinosaurs.“We wanted to name it Kermitops because we wanted to bring attention to this unique fossil that’s really small, that most people would not notice if you were to put it next to a Tyrannosaurus in the gallery,” So said.', 'About 74,000 years ago, Sumatra’s Mount Toba experienced a super-eruption, one of the largest in Earth’s history, potentially kicking off a massive disruption in\\xa0the world’s climate.Some scientists have suspected a volcanic winter resulting from the eruption\\xa0was a big enough shift to wipe out most early humans due to genetic evidence suggesting a steep drop in the human population. But now a cutting-edge study on an archaeological site in northwest Ethiopia once occupied by early modern humans has added to a growing body of evidence that suggests the event might not have been so apocalyptic.Instead, the new research found humans in that location, known as Shinfa-Metema 1, adapted to the arid conditions brought on by the volcanic eruption in a way that may have facilitated humanity’s pivotal migration out of Africa to the rest of the world.Microscopic fragments of volcanic glass found alongside stone tools and animal remains in the same layer of sediment at the Shinfa-Metema 1 site, near Ethiopia’s Shinfa River, show humans were occupying the site before and after the volcano erupted more than 4,000 miles away.“These fragments are less than the diameter of a human hair. Even as tiny as (that) they are still big enough to analyze the chemistry and the trace elements,” said John Kappelman, a professor of anthropology and geological science at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of the study, which published Wednesday in the journal Nature.By piecing together clues from the fossils and artifacts found at the site, along with geological and molecular analysis, the team began to understand how the humans living there forged ahead despite the likely climate shift that the volcanic cataclysm triggered.To understand the climate around the time of the eruption, Kappelman and his colleagues analyzed oxygen and carbon isotopes, variations of the same element, from ostrich eggshells and fossilized mammal teeth. That work shed light on water intake and revealed the animals ate plants that were more likely to grow in drier conditions.“The isotopes are incorporated in the hard tissues. So for the mammals, we look at their teeth, the enamel of their teeth, but we also find it in the eggshell of the ostrich,” he said.An analysis of the site’s flora and fauna also found an abundance of fish remains in the aftermath of the eruption. The finding is perhaps not surprising given how near the site was to the river, but fish are rare in other Stone Age sites from the same period, the study noted.“People start to increase the percentage of fish in the diet when Toba comes in. They’re capturing and processing almost four times as much fish (as before the eruption),” he said.“We think the reason for that is because if Toba is in fact, creating more aridity, that means it’s going to be a shorter wet season, which means longer dry season.”The team theorized that the drier climate, counterintuitively, explains the increased reliance on fish: As the river shrank, fish were trapped in water holes or shallower streams that hunters could more easily target.The fish-rich water holes may have potentially created what the team described as a “blue corridor,” along which early humans moved north out of Africa once they were depleted of fish. This theory contradicts most other models that suggest that humanity’s main migration out of Africa took place along “green corridors” during humid periods.“This study … demonstrates the great plasticity of Homo sapiens populations and their ability to adapt easily to any type of environment, whether hyper-humid or hyper-arid, including during catastrophic events such as the hyper-explosion of the Toba volcano,” said Ludovic Slimak, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the University of Toulouse, in an email. Slimak was not involved in the research.The study authors were also able to explore the geology of the ancient riverbed, which suggested that it flowed slower and lower at that point than in the present.“We can do that by just looking at the cobbles,” Kappelman said. “A very energetic river can move bigger boulders and cobbles than a river that isn’t that (energetic.) What (cobbles) we find for the ancestor river are smaller than the river today.”The researchers also uncovered the remains of several small triangular points, which tantalizingly rank among the earliest examples of the use of archery and provide clues that the site’s inhabitants might have used bows and arrows to hunt fish and other larger prey.Slimak, who has studied similar points discovered in France that date back 50,000 years, agreed with the new study’s assessment of the artifacts.“The authors also highlight very clear indicators suggesting the existence of archery here 74,000 years ago,” Slimak said. “There is therefore every reason to … consider these ancient Homo sapiens as bearers of already highly advanced technologies, largely emancipated from natural and climatic constraints, crucial factors for understanding their migrations later on, across all continents and under all latitudes.”Ancient species of humans likely left Africa multiple times, but archaeologists and geneticists largely agree that the most significant dispersal of Homo sapiens, our own species — which ultimately led to modern humans living in every corner of the globe — took place around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago.The new research offers another potential scenario for how this dispersal happened while not ruling out previous theories, said Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader in human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, who called it an “intriguing paper.”“I’m sure each of these propositions will fuel debate amongst the relevant specialists but I think the authors have made a plausible (though not definitive) case for each scenario they propose,” Stringer said via email.“Of course this new work doesn’t mean that humid corridors were not still important conduits for dispersals out of Africa, but this work adds credible additional possibilities during more arid phases.”', 'The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Apple wants to break the company’s notoriously tight grip on the iPhone, the device that’s made it one of the biggest and most profitable companies on the planet.But regardless of what happens in court, the case is already shining a light on the two faces of Apple: the cool, high-end tech brand that customers adore; and the ruthless, unavoidable behemoth that developers loathe.Here’s the deal: The Feds say Apple is maintaining a monopoly that stifles competition, deprives consumers of choice and ultimately forces them to pay more.Apple’s response to the allegations is, more or less, a) no we don’t, and b) good luck proving customer harm when everybody loves us.And that’s where this Goliath versus Goliath battle gets interesting.Customers really like Apple. We love the phones, the watches, the laptops and the AirPods that ensure we never have to be alone with our thoughts (unless, heaven help you, you forgot to charge them).\\xa0Heck, I’m typing this article on an Apple keyboard connected to a MacBook connected to iCloud, and I would throw a fit if I had to switch to a PC.Apple even nodded to this in its widely circulated statement to the media Thursday:“We innovate every day to make technology people love – designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users.”Magical!The company added: “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”And it’s true — the gods saw fit to get Steve Jobs and Jony Ive (the revered product designer behind Apple’s biggest hits) in the same room at the same time, and the world was never the same.Their products married good design and good software. They were never cheap, but they were shiny, user-friendly, simply beautiful. With help from the best marketing team in Silicon Valley history, Apple became a tech icon with a billion devotees.But on the business side, Apple is not so beloved.The company has a reputation for quashing competition and squeezing developers with exorbitant fees. Many smaller tech companies hate Apple as much as they live in fear of its lawyers.“Apple has this practice of seeing what others innovate for the phone, copying it, and then making it so that those others can’t compete,” Adam Wolfson, an antitrust lawyer with the firm Quinn Emanuel, told me. (There’s even an industry term for when Apple appropriates a third party’s tech, called “Sherlocking” — a nod to one of Apple’s search products that rendered its non-Apple rival, Watson, redundant.)“They very much have an approach to being about as sharp-elbowed as you can possibly get,” said Wolfson, who has represented clients in Apple disputes. “Apple is extraordinarily litigious, and will fight to the very last breath, because it can.”The DOJ lawsuit argues Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by blocking innovative new apps and services.If you’re an iPhone user and you’ve ever been in a text thread with someone using an Android device, you know the green-bubble problem and how annoying it is. It’s not as if Apple can’t make that experience better, according to the DOJ — it just doesn’t want to, because it’s better for Apple if its users see Android as a social faux pas. It’s tech tribalism, and Apple is a master at cultivating loyalty.The green bubble issue is just one of several ways Apple is abusing its dominant position, according to the lawsuit. (My colleague David Goldman has more on that here.)If it succeeds, the Justice Department\\xa0could force Apple to loosen some of the restrictions it has placed on its “walled garden” approach, which Apple says is meant to create a seamless experience for users and keep them relatively safe from viruses.That is a concern for investors, says Gene Muster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, because the lawsuit goes after “the juiciest part of their business.”But Muster doesn’t expect the lawsuit to be a body blow for the company, and believes “people will still gravitate to Apple products.”Indeed, customer satisfaction is, paradoxically, a tricky issue for the DOJ as well. People are pretty content with their iPhones. Could we be more content with more competition? Maybe. The DOJ will have their work cut out for them trying to prove it.Ultimately, Wolfson said, “the law wants to make sure that consumers are getting the absolute best, not just what Apple decides we want.”', 'A federal judge has dismissed a criminal indictment against seven Twitter users and a podcaster accused of running a $100 million stock manipulation scheme over social media.The Justice Department did not do enough to describe the influencers’ activities as a “scheme to defraud,”\\xa0wrote District Judge Andrew\\xa0Hanen of\\xa0the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in an order dated Wednesday.In the indictment, the DOJ had alleged a lucrative “pump and dump” scheme in which the social media influencers used the messaging app Discord to promote certain stocks to their followers before selling their positions after a run-up in the stocks’ prices. The result was an alleged conspiracy by defendants “to unlawfully enrich themselves by pumping and dumping securities …\\xa0through false and misleading posts and material omissions on Twitter [and Discord].”At least one of the defendants whose account CNN previously reviewed had tweeted about Gamestop and AMC, two so-called “meme stocks” that saw significant public interest and trading in 2021.On Wednesday, however, Hanen wrote that while the defendants may well have intended to separate followers from their money, the evidence did not support a finding of actual securities fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud.“The key question is whether one statement by one of the co-defendants that ‘we’re robbing … idiots of their money,’ which is alleged in the Indictment, is sufficient,” the judge wrote. “This statement sufficiently alleges ‘intent to defraud’ … but does not on its own sufficiently allege that Defendants executed, or conspired to execute, a ‘scheme to defraud’ investors of money or property” as defined by court precedent.Unlike a traditional fraud case, Hanen added, the DOJ merely claimed investors were deprived of relevant market information — not that the influencers directly stole money from investors.The indictment was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could potentially be amended and refiled.The DOJ case is distinct from a civil suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission around the same time against those same defendants and that accused them of violating US securities law. The SEC’s case is currently on hold, after the Justice Department asked the court in January 2023 to stay that lawsuit while its own criminal case against the defendants unfolded.The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the plaintiff in the case. It is the Justice Department. The photo has also been replaced.', '“Buy your mom an iPhone.”That was Apple CEO Tim Cook’s famous response at Vox’s 2022 Code Conference, when a reporter complained that her mother couldn’t see the videos she texted to her mom’s Android phone because they were grainy and slow.It’s also a quip that US Attorney General Merrick Garland quoted – and sharply criticized – Thursday at a press conference announcing the Justice Department’s landmark antitrust lawsuit against Apple, in which the Biden administration and 16 states allege Apple is illegally abusing the iPhone’s monopoly power in the smartphone market.The massive lawsuit against one of the world’s largest companies claims Apple is breaking the law by carefully curating its app store and customer experience, designed to lure customers in and keep them buying Apple products and services – to the exclusion of competitors.Apple, in a statement, said it disagreed with the lawsuit and would fight it vigorously.“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,” the company said.If successful, the suit could force Apple to loosen some of the restrictions it has placed on its “walled garden” approach to hardware and software. It could be made to open up its iPhone to alternative app stores and its technologies like iMessage with Android phones.The Justice Department, in its complaint, highlighted five ways it says Apple is abusing its dominant position to the detriment of Americans.With iMessage, Apple created an enhanced text messaging service that allows people to seamlessly communicate with one another, sending rich text, high-quality video and audio that uploads almost instantly – as long as it’s sent to another iPhone customer.When those messages get sent to people with Android phones, they appear grainy, they can be slow to load, and they can miss out on key features like emoji responses, editing functionality and end-to-end encryption. The dreaded “green bubbles” that mark Android users within iMessage – and particularly the lower-quality performance – are illegal, the Justice Department alleges.“As any iPhone user who has ever seen a green text message, or received a tiny, grainy video can attest — Apple’s anticompetitive conduct also includes making it more difficult for iPhone users to message with users of non-Apple products,” Garland said on Thursday. “As a result, iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse — even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging. And it does so intentionally.”Apple last year said it would adopt a new standard of technology for communication with Android phones that will open up some, but not all, of those features. The green bubbles will remain.Apple helped revolutionize the way we pay for things, tying customers’ credit cards to technology inside iPhones to make payments more secure and seamless. And Apple takes a tiny payment for each transaction.But Apple Pay is the only way iPhone owners can pay for stuff using that technology on an iPhone. Apple, citing security reasons, doesn’t allow third-party apps to access the chip that allows for iPhones to make mobile payments. It also could entice some customers to stick with iPhones when they’d otherwise switch to a competitor, the lawsuit alleges.“Apple also deprives users of the benefits and innovations third-party wallets would provide,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Cross-platform digital wallets would offer an easier, more seamless, and potentially more secure way for users to switch from the iPhone to another smartphone.”Apple Watch, one of Apple’s most successful products, is not compatible with Android phones – on purpose, the Justice Department alleges.Although some smartwatches work seamlessly with any kind of smartphone, Apple Watches, a market leader, require iPhones to operate. That locks customers into Apple’s ecosystem of hardware and software, forcing Apple Watch customers to buy iPhones.“Apple uses smartwatches, a costly accessory, to prevent iPhone customers from choosing other phones,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Having copied the idea of a smartwatch from third-party developers, Apple now prevents those developers from innovating and limits the Apple Watch to the iPhone to prevent a negative ‘impact to iPhone sales.’”The only way to get apps on an iPhone is through Apple’s proprietary app store. Apple has long claimed that its approach to maintaining what apps can and cannot be used on an iPhone helps customers. It prevents spam and harmful apps, Apple says.It forces apps into Apple’s onerous limitations and expensive 30% commissions, the Justice Department argues. And it limits competition.For example, the Justice Department cites cloud-based gaming app stores as a service that Apple illegally prevents from appearing on an iPhone. Companies that want to stream games to customers have to load each individual game to the app store, which prevents companies from marketing and selling potentially powerful and popular competitive technology to customers.Apple forces app developers to write code specifically for its operating system, restricting developers from coding using universal languages that could offer a single app experience across any device.That prevents apps from becoming “super apps” – apps that run identically on Apple’s iOS iPhone operating system and Google’s Android OS. Apple also restricts “mini programs” – apps within apps that effectively run on the web. The Justice Department says that requirement locks developers into Apple’s system.“Since at least 2017, Apple has arbitrarily imposed exclusionary requirements that unnecessarily and unjustifiably restrict mini programs and super apps,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Apple exerted its control over app distribution to stifle others’ innovation.”', 'The US Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.It’s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the US government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.The complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that ”Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.”“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,” he added.The long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its “walled-garden” approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling – and in some cases, restricting – how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth’s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.The company said it denied the lawsuit’s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government “to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”But Garland on Thursday said Apple’s actions have wide-ranging effects.“Monopolies like Apple’s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,” Garland said Thursday.“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there’s a law for that,” he added.For example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message – but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.The company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors’ products are far more limited in their capabilities.“Apple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,” Garland said on Thursday.This year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone’s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.And Apple maintains a 30% commission on most sales through its app store – a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple’s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.“We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,” Apple said in a statement.Thursday’s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.Apple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a “dangerous\\xa0precedent” and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love – designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in its statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”Thursday’s lawsuit against Apple seeks three specific remedies that could dramatically change the company’s business model.The Justice Department wants a court order barring Apple from using its app store to block innovative new apps. It also wants the court to block Apple-imposed restrictions that prevent other messaging apps, smartwatches, digital wallets and other technologies from integrating with the iPhone.It also called for the court to prevent Apple from using its contractual terms to “obtain, maintain, extend, or entrench” the company’s alleged monopoly.The complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by CNN, does not explicitly call for a breakup of Apple. But it did not rule out the possibility, and asks for “relief as needed to cure any competitive harm.”According to the complaint, the list of participating states or districts in the suit include New Jersey, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.Apple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.But the Justice Department’s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple’s practices.The case represents the Biden administration’s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under US antitrust law.Apple was named in\\xa0a sprawling House report\\xa0in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold “monopoly power.” Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.The legal action could weigh on Apple’s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.Apple’s (AAPL) stock fell 3% Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.Along with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration’s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.The Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden’s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.Along with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.To solve Android phone customers’ “green bubble” issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.“It lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,” Migicovsky said. “Technologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.”Those kind of interactions have made Apple’s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.Beginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game “Fortnite.”Apple isn’t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.Those rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don’t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.The US government isn’t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.In a seismic move to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.But critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.Since its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It’s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple’s restrictiveness.In the era led by founder Steve Jobs, “Apple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,” said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. “Apple relentlessly innovated. They were always steps ahead of the competition.”Now, however, Apple’s advances are more “incremental” than earth-shattering, Bailey added. “[CEO Tim] Cook has been focused on financial management and expanding market share.”“Apple’s financially healthy,” Bailey said, but their reputation for innovation is “dimming.”This story has been updated with additional context and developments.', 'Tim Cook\\xa0is making a high-profile visit to China that coincides\\xa0with Apple opening a huge new store in Shanghai — its second biggest in the world.\\xa0It’s all part of a push\\xa0by the company to reverse a decline in iPhone sales in its most important international market.The new $11.6 million outlet — located in Shanghai’s central district of Jing’an, which is named after a historic temple — is the biggest in China and the second only to Apple’s flagship store on New York’s Fifth Avenue, Chinese state media reported.“Nonghao Shanghai!” Apple CEO Cook said in a Weibo post on Wednesday, which means “hello” in Shanghainese.\\xa0“I’m always so happy to be back in this remarkable city.”Cook said he had spent the morning enjoying a traditional breakfast of what appeared to be soup dumplings and soy milk and taking selfies along the city’s famous Bund waterfront with local actor Zheng Kai.In Shanghai, mainland China’s financial hub, Apple now has eight stores, the largest number of any city in the country. There are currently 47 Apple stores in 24 cities across mainland China.The new addition comes as Apple (AAPL) tries to fend off competitors and revive sales in a rocky market with growing headwinds, ranging from an economic slowdown to geopolitical tensions and rising nationalist sentiment.In 2023, Apple grabbed the top spot in China’s smartphone market for the first time ever, with a record 17.3% market share, according to IDC Research.But during the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales in the country slumped 24% from a year ago, according to a separate report by Counterpoint Research from earlier this month. Apple’s market share slid behind that of Vivo, Huawei, and Honor in that period, it added, while rival Huawei’s sales soared 64%.Cook’s visit, his third to the country in a year, underscores China’s significance to Apple as its biggest overseas market and a critical part of its manufacturing supply chain.“China remains a critical market for Apple, particularly in the premium segment above $800, where it holds a dominant position,” said Ivan Lam, senior analyst from Counterpoint.“With Huawei’s resurgence and other Chinese [phone makers] gaining traction in offline sales, Apple is proactively strengthening its offline presence, leveraging flagship stores as a key tool to promote high-end smartphones,” he said.Earlier this month, Apple announced it would expand its research center in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and unveiled plans to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen later this year.“China is the heart and lungs of Apple’s growth strategy as Cupertino doubles down on its China strategy with these moves,” said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities.On Wednesday, Cook hosted an information sharing session along with three of Apple’s suppliers — BYD, Lens Technology and Everwin Precision Technology — at its Shanghai office, according to state media reports.“There’s no supply chain in the world more critical to Apple than that of China,” Cook told a group of reporters.He met with Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD, the world’s largest electrical vehicle maker, at the session, according to a video he posted on his Weibo account.Cook praised Chinese suppliers as having “the most advanced manufacturing in the world,” according to China Daily.The Apple CEO also visited a film production studio, talked with mobile game developers and took photos with a crowd of shoppers and staff, according to his social media posts.“Cook is not taking a step back from China. It’s the opposite as competition from Huawei ramps up domestically,” Ives said.Apple still has many fans in the country. More than a hundred of them waited in line overnight to be among the first to enter the new store or to get a photo with Cook, according to videos and state media reports circulated on Weibo.Others told CNN they were planning to go.“I’ll go and kinda ‘worship’ the store,” said Dolores, a movie producer in Beijing. She has been using the iPhone, iPad and MacBook for years. “I’ve already grown used to its design and the system,” she said, calling the products “sleek and beautiful.”Wei, a Beijing resident, also said he would visit.“I’ve heard that it’s quite big,” he said. “I just want to have a look.”Both said they would stay loyal to the brand, despite rising calls on the Chinese internet for consumers to switch to homegrown brands to show their patriotism.“Some Chinese brands like Huawei are also doing well with their products. But [I won’t switch.] It should be about mutual achievement [for Apple and Chinese brands], rather than hostility,” Dolores said.“For international products, if you like a brand, there should be no geopolitical divisions,” Wei said. “Just look at the products.”', 'Pope Francis unexpectedly skipped delivering his homily during the Palm Sunday Mass service at the Vatican on Sunday, although was able to preside over the service and was later driven around in the popemobile.The service\\xa0marks the beginning of Holy Week, the most sacred week in the church’s calendar as Christians around the world prepare to celebrate Easter, and his decision to skip the homily (reflection) was a surprise.The 87-year-old has in recent weeks had aides read out several of his speeches after suffering from a bout of ill health, which on 28 February saw him go to hospital for tests.Over the winter months, Francis has battled with bouts of bronchitis, cold and flu.While the pope has occasionally skipped homilies on Easter Sunday, it is the first time he has not given a homily on Palm Sunday.Francis did speak during the Mass, reading prayers and giving his blessing. He also prayed the Angelus at the conclusion of the liturgy, beforehand recalling the “martyred people of Ukraine” and those suffering from war.At the end of the liturgy, he greeted cardinals individually from his wheelchair, which he has been using for several months. He then got into the popemobile to greet some of the thousands of people gathered in the square.Following the service, he also condemned the “vile” concert hall shooting in Moscow. Francis told the crowd at St. Peter’s Square that he was praying for the “victims of the vile terrorist attack,” the worst that Russia has suffered in recent decades.On Saturday, the pope met with employees from Italian state broadcaster RAI where he delivered a speech and on 8 March spoke at length at a parish in Rome.Holy Week and Easter is an intense schedule for the pope. He is to travel to a prison outside of Rome on Thursday to celebrate the foot washing ritual with female prisoners, and on Good Friday be present at services in St Peter’s and the Colosseum.On Easter Saturday evening he’s due to preside at a long evening liturgy and on Easter Sunday offer his “Urbi et Orbi” blessing to the city of Rome and the world.', 'What happens when others assume people with Down syndrome can’t hit hard, aim high or drink a darn margarita?Well, it can become a reality.A new Down syndrome awareness ad cuts right to the philosophical heart of this often-misunderstood condition, reminding us that the way we treat people with Down syndrome can help smash false limits — or reinforce them.False limits like, say, someone of-age not being able to drink just because they have Down syndrome.“If your assumptions become reality, then assume I can drink a margarita. So you serve me a margarita, so I drink a margarita,” says actress Madison Tevlin in the now-viral ad.The same goes for things like living alone, having sex or any other achievement, both great and small.“Assume that I can, so maybe I will,” the spot concludes.The ad, created by an Italian Down syndrome organization called Coor Down, was released in recognition of World Down Syndrome Awareness Day, March 21. Its tagline, #AssumeICan, is being used by people with Down Syndrome to show that many of the assumptions about their drive and abilities are just that … assumptions.Tevlin, the 22-year-old actress who starred in the ad, talked to CNN about tearing down stereotypes while also celebrating the differences people with Down syndrome bring to the table.“When I was born, the doctor told my mom and dad that life would be really hard for me, saying that I can’t talk, or walk, or dance, or model, or act — or drinking or getting married — any of this stuff that’s part of normal life,” she said. “And it’s so much fun proving people wrong.”Tevlin was connected to the Coor Down campaign through the National Down Syndrome Society, and says she’s loving the reactions to the ad, which has 160,000 views on YouTube and has been burning up social media feeds.“I’m just so happy everyone looks up to me as a role model.”Other Down syndrome activists and achievers are sharing their own ways they defy stereotypes, like 17-year-old triathlete Caleb Prewitt, or members of the Hijinx Theatre, an inclusive theatre company in Wales.Down syndrome is a condition caused by an extra partial or full chromosome. According to the National Down Syndrome Society, one in 772 babies in the US is born with Down Syndrome. It’s not a disease or an affliction, it’s just the way some people are made.While Down syndrome results in slight cognitive delays, the NDSS says these issues are usually “mild to moderate” and don’t affect people’s ability to vote, contribute to their communities or make decisions about their own lives.As an actress and advocate, Tevlin has taken control of her own life. She says getting past stereotypes about Down syndrome allows the whole person to shine through.“I always say that I have Down syndrome, and it’s the least interesting thing about me,” she said. “The part of who I am, well it’s not all of me. We should all celebrate our differences in our own special and unique ways.”CNN’s Taylor Galgano and Krista Bo contributed to this report.', 'Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed Friday she has been diagnosed with cancer and is in the “early stages” of treatment.The princess, known as Kate, described her diagnosis as a “huge shock” in a video statement released on social media. The news comes two months after she had temporarily stepped away from public life following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition.“In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous,” said Catherine, 42, who is married to the heir to the British throne, Prince William.“The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.”Kate continued that “William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.”The princess added, “As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be ok.”Kate said that she had told them she is “well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits.”She praised Prince William for being by her side as “a great source of comfort and reassurance” as well as the support she has received from the public.“We hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery,” the princess said.She ended her heartfelt message by saying that she was also keeping “all those whose lives have been affected by cancer” in her thoughts.“For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone,” Kate concluded in the video statement, which was filmed by BBC Studios at Windsor on Wednesday.CNN understands the Prince and Princess of Wales wanted to wait for their young children to be out of school for the Easter holidays before making the announcement.Prince William has been balancing supporting his wife and children while continuing his public-facing duties and will continue to do so, a royal source told CNN.The princess started preventative chemotherapy in late February, the source said, adding that Kate had been expected to return to official duties after Easter, however she will now postpone further work until she has been cleared to do so by her medical team.Kensington Palace is not expected to reveal any further medical details such as the type of cancer or what stage it is.Preventative chemotherapy is often used after surgery as an “adjuvant” therapy, to weaken the chances of cancer returning, Dr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, told CNN.The news is a devastating blow for the British monarchy and comes as\\xa0King Charles III is currently undergoing treatment\\xa0for an unspecified cancer, which was announced by Buckingham Palace in early February.King Charles said he was “so proud” of Catherine, his daughter-in-law, for “her courage in speaking as she did” in sharing her cancer diagnosis, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said late Friday.Charles said he “remained in the closest contact” with Kate since they received treatment at the same London hospital, and that he and Queen Camilla will “continue to offer their love and support to the whole family through this difficult time.”Kate was admitted to The London Clinic, a private hospital in the city, on January 16 and successfully underwent a planned abdominal surgery, Kensington Palace said at the time. She remained in the hospital for 13 days following the procedure and, on doctor’s advice, had since been away from public duties during her recovery.Kate was spotted in public for the first time since her surgery, visiting a farm shop with her husband Prince William last weekend, amid intense speculation about her health and whereabouts.Since the announcement on Friday, well wishes have poured in for the princess.Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex said\\xa0in a joint statement that they “wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.”British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement that the princess had “the love and support of the whole country,” adding that Kate had shown “tremendous bravery” and that she had been “unfairly treated” during weeks of “intense scrutiny” by the press and on social media. He added that his thoughts were with her and “in particular her three children.”British opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer also sent his “best wishes” to the princess, saying that the “lurid speculation” of recent weeks must have “added” to her stress.Meanwhile, the White House said the update from the princess was “terrible” and that the administration was “incredibly sad to hear of the news.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration’s thoughts were with the royal and her family “during this incredibly difficult time, and certainly we wish her a full recovery.”Jean-Pierre stressed it was “important that we respect their privacy, especially at this time, so I’m not going to go further than that.”', 'A United Nations Security Council resolution proposed by the United States calling for a ceasefire tied to the release of hostages in Gaza failed to pass on Friday, after Russia and China vetoed the draft.The rejected draft resolution called for “an immediate and sustained ceasefire… in connection with the release of all remaining hostages.” Washington had previously vetoed three prior UN resolutions calling for a ceasefire.The UN vote came amid resumed hostage talks in Qatar on Friday, and as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of an intensive diplomatic push toward a ceasefire.The US, Israel’s most prominent defender on the world stage, has faced severe criticism in Arab countries and in Europe for its refusal to call for a ceasefire early in the Gaza war as well as its reluctance to translate its verbal criticism of Israel’s conduct to diplomatic action.Eleven security council members voted for the resolution but permanent members Russia and China, who have veto power, blocked it. Israel Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan said the Security Council’s decision “not to condemn Hamas is a stain that will never be forgotten.”Meanwhile, Algeria – which also rejected the resolution – said the submitted text “was not a clear message of peace, and would have allowed for more Palestinian civilians to be killed.”\\xa0 The US had previously rejected a ceasefire resolution put forth by Algeria.With the draft resolution, Washington was seeking to recover from international criticism of its support for Israel, experts say.The resolution included phrasing that the US was unwilling to use before, said Frank Lowenstein, who worked as US Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations under US President Barack Obama during the 2014 Israel-Gaza war. This referred to an “immediate ceasefire,” which the former diplomat said was likely a bid to bring the US back from months of international “isolation.”“It gets the US back in line with the international community so we’re not as isolated as we’ve been in vetoing,” he said.Lowenstein said that Russia and China’s veto was “a blatant effort” to keep the US isolated. “They (Russia and China) are playing politics with the ceasefire, clearly putting their desire to isolate the US internationally ahead of the interests of the Palestinians in Gaza who desperately need a ceasefire,” he said.The US struck down a draft resolution on October 18 that called for “humanitarian pauses,” which US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield vetoed as it “did not mention Israel’s right of self-defense.”The US vetoed a second UN resolution on December 8, rejecting a version put forth by the United Arab Emirates that called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” as well as “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages” and “ensuring humanitarian access.”More recently, US vetoed an Algerian resolution on February 20 that called for an immediate ceasefire, which Thomas-Greenfield said “would put sensitive negotiations in jeopardy.”Washington’s attitude toward Israel’s war policies gradually changed, however, amid mounting death tolls in Gaza and growing opposition to what American and international observers perceived as the Biden administration’s inability to reign in its Israeli ally.US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this month traded barbs in interviews over Israel’s war, and especially about Israel’s planned incursion into Rafah.The US even sanctioned Israeli settlers in the West Bank, and Biden publicly praised a speech by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that called for new Israeli elections that would replace Netanyahu.“I think there has been a gap from day one, a gap between the language and the actions,” said Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London.“But I think gradually, the language and the action are coming closer, closing the gap, millimeter by millimeter.”If the US resolution had passed, it would have been “the end of giving Israel the carte blanche to do whatever they like,” he said, speaking to CNN before Friday’s vote. “The (strain in) relations between the two countries is unprecedented.”Lowenstein said the resolution is “a strong signal” to Israel there are consequences to defying the US on its requests for humanitarian aid and against a Rafah incursion. It also meant to get all parties to agree on a ceasefire-hostage deal, particularly Hamas, he told CNN.', 'Fresh off of his Oscar win for best actor, it looks like Cillian Murphy hasn’t forgotten where he came from.Steven Knight, creator of the beloved crime drama “Peaky Blinders,” told Birmingham World Murphy is set to reprise his role as gang leader Tommy Shelby in the planned “Peaky Blinders” movie.“He definitely is returning for it,” Knight told the publication. “We’re shooting it in September just down the road in Digbeth.”CNN has reached out to representatives for Murphy for comment.The actor was the darling of this most recent awards season for his portrayal of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in the Christopher Nolan film “Oppenheimer.”Fans of “Peaky Blinders” had expressed interest on social media as to whether Murphy would return to the role given his great success with “Oppenheimer.”', 'On Tuesday, a starry guestlist poured into the regal halls of London’s National Portrait Gallery for the museum’s first fundraising Gala since its hefty three-year remodel completed in 2023. Against the backdrop of 1700s portraiture, former British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, artist Tracey Emin and Dame Kristen Scott Thomas (now a Miu Miu catwalk model as well as a BAFTA Award-winning actor) were snapped in their frocks and tuxedos, adhering to a dress code of “glamour.”With many attendees from the upper echelons of the British creative scene choosing to champion homegrown labels — Alexa Chung wore Erdem, TV presenter Maya Jama opted for a satin, off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood number — one could imagine a born-and-bred Californian could feel daunted. But Hole singer Courtney Love certainly got the memo. Straying from the London Fashion Week mainstays, Love instead chose to revive a name from fashion history — and arrived in the biggest (and arguably the best) gown of the evening.Dressed in a waterfall of gray silk duchess satin and black tulle, Love was the punk princess of St. Martin’s Place. And it was no wonder, considering the 18th-century inspired gown was the work of Elizabeth Emanuel, Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer.The custom look was a variation on Emanuel’s “Marie Antoinette” frock which Love had spotted in last month’s copy of British high-society gossip magazine, Tatler. Originally designed in pale pink, Love’s version was fashioned out of a darker palette for more drama. Emanuel added crystal appliques at the waist, while the corset itself was boned and fastened with black lacing. Most captivating of all, perhaps, was the bustle skirt silhouette, hand-draped by Emanuel. “The effect was very grown up (yet) ‘Princess’ like,” she told CNN via email.Dress designer Emanuel rose to fame when she received the commission of a lifetime in 1981. The gown she created for Princess Diana’s wedding to Prince Charles — a pearl-embellished, ivory taffeta dress complete with ‘80s puff sleeves and a 25-foot train — has since gone down in history as one of the most iconic moments in fashion. In June 2021, 40 years after it was worn down the aisle, the dress was exhibited at Diana’s former home in Kensington Palace.Later in the evening, Love is photographed stepping behind the decks to DJ. An outstretched arm shows a torn tulle sleeve — snagged presumably while she was lost in the music. The\\xa0 mark of a true people’s princess.']\n",
